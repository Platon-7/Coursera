## Introduction

This is the documentation for the simple Shiny app designed to predict the species of a flower.

## Idea

The idea is very straightforward, we use the iris dataset and attempt to predict the species of a flower. This is done by 
using the petal and sepal dimensions. We create a model that is trained with the default values of the iris dataset and 
then the rest is up to the user.

The user is free to choose the dimensions of his flower and the app classifies its species by using the model that we created 
previously.

## Notes to the user

Just slide to choose the values you want and see your flower's species!

## Error handling

To avoid user errors we use sliders and not numerical input so there is no way that the user can make the app crash.
