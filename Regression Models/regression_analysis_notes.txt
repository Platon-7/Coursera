Introduction

* The slope of the regression line is the estimate of the coefficient, or multiplier of the independent variable of our data.


Total Variation = Residual Variation + Regression Variation

Which sum of squared term represents Residual Variation? -> Yi - Yi_hat

Which sum of squared term represented Total Variation? -> Yi - mean(Yi)


The ratio sRes(Residual Variation)/sTot(Total Variation) represents the percent of total variation contributed by the residuals. 

Regression Variation = 1 - sRes/sTot (in a percentage)

We'll now summarize useful facts about R^2. It is the percentage of variation explained by the regression model. As a percentage it is between 0 and 1.
It also equals the sample correlation squared. However, R^2 doesn't tell the whole story.
