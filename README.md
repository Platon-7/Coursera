# Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning

These courses are part of the Data Science Specialization Coursera course offered by the Johns Hopkins University. The whole certificate required these 5 courses 
and I completed them in parallel with my Bachelor studies. The initial goal was just to get some extra knowledge especially from the area of Statistics, but I 
found the courses fun, relatively easy and interesting, so I decided to complete all of them. The programming language used is R and the projects follow a hands-on
philosophy, trying to engage the student with direct real-world problems.
