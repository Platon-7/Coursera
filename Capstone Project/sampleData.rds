Someone asked me the other day This post makes me wonder how you would describe the high calling of working in a video store I confess that I find it difficult to practice the presence of God at work It is extremely difficult to find God in the faces of mostly unhappy and lethargic people who are convinced that we charge too much for our rentals and that it is perfectly unreasonable that their credit card should be on file with our store I wonder to myself How can I find God in the face of a customer who is intent on renting the latest installment of American Pie or the most recent Zalman King exploration of the world of How can I find the face of God Id settle for a burning bush when a customer is challenging me to a fist fight in the parking lot because his credit card was declined

The motif forms the basis of certain ghost stories such as M R James Number In this story an old Danish hotel occupying what once was a medieval building has a room and a room next to each other the omitted for superstitious reasons as is common enough Each is a large room with three windows at one end Ah but when night falls a room mysteriously appears between the two and grow narrower and lose each a window to number There are weird sounds and grotesque silhouettes to be seen opposite that particular room on the wall of an adjacent building where the light shines out through the hotels windows onto the blank surface I wont spoil the rest of the story but medieval deviltry is involved The point is the old room appears and disappears in the presence of the Supernatural and sometimes we mortals get caught in this netherworld and experience it too

On the beer update front the only beer new to Austin I have purchased and consumed in the past week is Decadence DIPA by Ska BrewingNot too much to say about this beer The hops were a weird mix of grassy citrus and pine The malt base was fairly strong and a fair amount of caramel seemed to overwhelm the hops It had a kind of Imperial Amber quality that I tend to likebut not when Im looking for a DIPA to melt my face off Given the fact that I purchased it looking for that facemelting hop qualityI was a little disappointed I think this beer rang in around bucks which made it taste better than if it were say bucks but Im not sure its worth a repeat purchase I have had this beer before at a tasting and dont remember it standing out then either Ska brewing has continued to underwhelm DO NOT waste your time with the Ska Blonde and the Pinstripe Amber is definitely a middle of the road amber at best We recently added the Amber to our beer lineup at work and I have expressed my disappointment to the bar manager Alas I am still a lowly internline cook so my opinion means very little Such is life Verdict is that the Decadence IPA is certainly worth a try at the price point

In respect of the first question whilst the sad decline of a number of the chicks due to the terrible weather over the weekend has made difficult viewing the option of intervening hasnt really been seriously considered by our conservation team for a number of reasons Firstly these are wild birds nesting in a location of their own choice and whilst we do have the privilege of watching the familys progress or possible decline we dont feel it would be right to directly interfere with the brood If we had tried to remove some of the chicks there would also have been the possibility that the adults may have abandoned the nest and any remaining healthy chicks

This is essentially a book that deals with the racial prejudices of yesterday and today Its a complicated subject and certainly not one that I feel I can address entirely in one book But I do think that any time we hear a new story it gives us a fresh perspective on our world and helps us to see things just a little bit more clearly

A double whammy of awesome I wanted to pick only one Terry Gilliam movie and his most fantastical adventure comes from The Adventures of Baron Munchausen with s Time Bandits a close second but once I decided on Munchausen that opened up another problem I love Karel Zemans Czechoslovak version just as much so The Fabulous Baron Munchausen aka Baron Prsil ties with Gilliams film Sorry original German version Both Gilliam and Zeman were amazingly visual artists in the realm of fantasy and both have extremely distinct styles and tones so both films are wonderful and inventive but in different ways Gilliams Munchausen features John Neville as the eponymous Baron going on a great journey to find his old friends and rescue a besieged town from invading Turks The Baron enters his own story and joined by a little girl Sarah Polley he flies a hot air balloon to the moon where he saves the impossibly fast Berthold Eric Idle from the zany King of the Moon Robin Williams From there they fall into the volcano of Mont Etna where Vulcan Oliver Reed and Venus Uma Thurman treat them to a tensionfilled tea break and floating waltz Then they are tossed into a whirlpool and are swallowed by a sea monster on the opposite side of the world Famous for being one of the biggest flops in movie history the film is in fact a staggering achievement from a technical standpoint and for humorfilled fantasy films as well Karel Zemans version is incredibly stylized and psychedelic His special effects may be older but they are no less baffling or impressive An astronaut lands on the moon only to discover the Baron who has been there for quite some time Together they go back to earth for one crazy adventure after another as they fight the Turks and each other for the attentions of the Princess The movie is a wonderful satirical innovative and a visual treat for fantasy lovers of all ages The Munchausens are fantasy untethered

The characters are all quite cliche Youve got the main character a sporty yet studious boy who has a need to get back home which drives him through the first half of the book and a sense of honor which drives him through the second half Then youve got the main supporting character an extremely smart yet extremely athletic girl who can outsmart and outrun the MC at every turn and who is a distinct feminist In a world where men rule that last point is important and comes up in any story of this kind Ferrin as Ive said is deceitful and helpful trademark Brandon Mull The blind king was probably my favorite character the way he lives a charade fabricated by his subjects and himself Drake was a good character too along with Jasher I like the seed men a lot Unfortunately the ages of the main characters Jason and Rachel are in question Theyre said to be thirteen years old but they seem to be through the whole thing I was wondering

The first thing any article about deja vu will tell you is that dont worry its totally normal Thanks guys Its good to know youre not officially calling me crazy but I dont think anyone in history has experienced deja vu and immediately checked themselves into a mental hospital or anything Its pretty well known guys In fact the earliest mentions of deja vu seem to be from St Augustine talking about Falsae memoriae conveniently choosing to write in the type of Latin that is basically silly English for ease of comprehension But the actual term deja vu wasnt coined until almost by a man named FL Arnaud Apparently he didnt like the fact that it was being referred to as false memory because maybe that wasnt what was occurring

It was so easy in fact that I anticipated the real work would begin with the second letter And of course I knew there HAD to be a second letter You see I went through a very rigorous graduate program in which I had to write twelve drafts of my dissertation proposal before I could even start my dissertation itself Twelve drafts some of which were accompanied by revision letters filled with very harsh words about my writing that might have more than once included sloppy So how could a professional editor at a publishing house be happy with one revision

Billy slowly drove into Caseys driveway and although she had been through a night of fear and terror she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasnt even sure if she would live to see daylight Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billys truck in lightening speed As she ran up to the drivers side and softly said I know exactly what happened last night Billy You guys drugged me and raped me And I will never forget it Youre going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me You can bet your that God will avenge my honor You may not go to jail but you will suffer for what you did to me Billy looked at her and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened This is probably due to the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget Evidently the effects werent as potent as Billy had hoped

To the question Is there a conspiracy to destroy the white race I have to say in my view the answer is considerably more complex than some of my fellow travellers would like to believe What we face is not a single malevolent conspiracy but a many headed hydra formed of any number aims ambitions hatreds and ideologies all of differing degrees of malevolence which have come together on the coat tails of a historical conspiracy to attack us at a time when we are at the least able to defend ourselves

It is unfortunate that you came in to The Bent Brick expecting us to comp your corkage because one of your party made the wine they brought in We dont expect and rarely receive free wine or services from wineries we dont know You shouldnt expect free services from unfamiliar parties either We have very many close contacts with local winemakers We have built our wine program around those relationships We treat these winemakers as our friends and family and they return to The Bent Brick frequently to taste their wines on our draft system You can talk to any of the fantastic local winemakers who have engaged us about our keg wine system and they will tell you volumes about how well we treat them when they come to The Bent Brick But it is impolite and disrespectful to walk in to a restaurant that you are unfamiliar with and expect them to give away services

But the phrase political questions can of course have a broader you might be inclined to say more natural meaning It might refer simply to questions with political significance questions that are part of public debate No one in Canada actually believes that courts should or can keep away from all questions political in this broader sense Could Qubec try to stamp out Communism Could Parliament create a federal securities regulator What rights should people suspected of terrorism have Those and countless others are political questions in the broader sense but there is no question that the Supreme Court was entitled to rule on them

ABSTRACT Mathematicians are well acquainted with Emmy Noether through her important work in abstract algebra such as her major contributions to the study of rings and ideals Regrettably Noether is less well known among physicists even though her theorem about transformations under Lie groups carries powerful applications to practically all of physics The few physicists who do know of Noethers Theorem by name typically recognize it in only the context of theories with gauge invariance

If you care to look at the videos or the stories that you read of people fighting back against the system its overwhelmingly older people doing it The younger generations simply dont care Now I know that there are movements like anonymous and reclaim the streets etc but theyre controlled opposition More so while the minority of youngsters may believe they are fighting against the NWO they are in fact implementing their wishes by promoting globalism multiculturalism New Age religions homosexuality etc and happily destroying culture traditions religious beliefs and morality bringing in a world of relative belief

But it isnt just suicide and though the few movies I have seen have been centered around families more or less there is so much more you can take from it The dialogue scenes in his movies are so deep that you pretty much need to pause the television and ponder over what he is trying to say Particularly in Norikos Dinner Table there are plenty of metaphors that are not so easy to understand after just seeing it once This is one of those movies that you can watch several times and find some new meaning behind it each time I have never claimed to be the intellectual type and I dont really get into the art house styled films like Battle in Heaven or The Scent of Green Papayas that bring out all the pseudointellectuals to ponder some deeper meaning personally I thought those movies were stupid and repulsive But in a way I could kind of see how Norikos Dinner Table might attract that type of crowd and true enough this film in particular is definitely not for everyone To say it is a slow burn is a complete understatement this movie creeps along in its character development clocking in at hours and minutes But I personally think this is one of the greatest and most thought provoking films of our time But as deep as Norikos Dinner Table is I have probably bitten off more than I can chew by trying to review a movie like this so where to begin

Over in Germany Schalke put on a fantastic tribute to Ral during his last game at the Veltins Arena and put Real Madrid to shame for still not honoring its former captain The club had organized a video tribute to Ral then he and his family took a lap around the stadium to bask in the adoration of the fans and then his jersey was retired What a lovely gesture from Schalke And to think that Ral only spent two years there what an impression he made Meanwhile Real Madrid his club of almost years has done absolutely nothing He deserves something similar in the Bernabu By the way Schalke won the game Ral scored one goal and our former player KlaasJan Huntelaar two more

Thats not to say that this novel was without its faults though My own novel focused on a young womans journey into the BDSM lifestyle but its supposed to show that thats a perfectly reasonable lifestyle to choose and she eventually realizes that she can be a strong independent woman and still make the choice to be a submissive This novel on the other hand seems to focus on how this is a crazy lifestyle that only people with troubled pasts choose We dont fully understand what all has happened to Christian but we know that he hates to be touched and had a very bad life the first few years of his life and that he has always felt out of place with his perfect adoptive family He turned to this lifestyle after having an affair with a married woman when he was because this was the only type of love that he found acceptable

Selden and Lily stood still accepting the unreality of the scene as a part of their own dreamlike sensations It would not have surprised them to feel a summer breeze on their faces or to see the lights among the boughs reduplicated in the arch of a starry sky The strange solitude about them was no stranger than the sweetness of being alone in it together At length Lily withdrew her hand and moved away a step so that her whiterobed slimness was outlined against the dusk of the branches Selden followed her and still without speaking they seated themselves on a bench beside the fountain

Jeff suggests that Crabaugh rather than proposing a poor system is in fact using it to critique the standard XP requirements Its an interesting thesis and I think hes probably on to something However I still have a problem with Crabaughs system and indeed most other buildyourowncharacterclass systems Ive seen The problem is that the system seems to assume that XP requirements are intended solely or at least primarily as a means of balancing the relative power of each class at first level On this understanding a thief takes so few XP to reach second level compared to say a fighter because a thief is such a pathetic class at st level Similarly all the demihuman classes require more XP than their humanonly counterparts as a way of compensating for their racial abilities

 We agree with the PTOs current position Section s language and legislative history as well as the differences between the two proceedings lead us to conclude that Congress did not intend a prior court judgment upholding the validity of a claim to prevent the PTO from finding a substantial new question of validity regarding an issue that has never been considered by the PTO To hold otherwise would allow a civil litigants failure to overcome the statutory presumption of validity to thwart Congress purpose of allowing for a reexamination procedure to correct examiner errors without which the presumption of validity never would have arisen See Patlex Fd at A defectively examined and therefore erroneously granted patent must yield to the reasonable Congressional purpose of facilitating the correction of governmental mistakes

Paleolithic humans foraged from hundreds of species of wild unhybridized plants that grew in rich soils that had never been farmed let alone farmed with pesticides and herbicides In modern society the best you can hope to achieve is to eat all or mostly organically grown plants of maybe a few dozen varieties most of which have been hybridized over generations to maximize appearance size and calories rather than nutrition and farmed on the same land over and over Even with the best organic farming practices minerals dont just appear from nowhere Soil loses some of its punch with every crop unless some artificial or natural process replenishes the minerals volcanoes glaciers etc In short even the best of modern food isnt anything like what our preagricultural forbears ate and to get adequate levels of some nutrients youd have to eat more food than is humanly possible Supplements are quite literally part of the cure for modernity

As for the origin of language no one can say for certain because it happened so far back in prehistory that theres little evidence available Research into this subject continues and perhaps someday more clues will be discovered I was surprised to find out though that preeminent linguist Noam Chomsky believes that language acquisition occurred over a short period of time as a result of a sudden gene mutation while most other experts think it evolved slowly Chomsky says To tell a fairy story about it it is almost as if there was some higher primate wandering around a long time ago and some random mutation took place maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower and it reorganized the brain implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain While cautioning against accepting this literally Chomsky insists that it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes including language Wikipedia Origins of Language

To start with Im short The reason I mention this is that there was a very tall gentleman that had become interested in me some years back We had friends in common in our little academic environment and I often would run into him at functions on campus His rather intense stare across rooms would be coupled with a shy hesitancy and obvious nervousness when in close proximity and frankly speaking I should have been flattered However and I apologize for my lack of metric abilities my to his height was to me laughable I love to dance and all I could think of was that there would never be a step stool around when necessary But I soon eliminated any possibility of this becoming an issue on the day he finally approached He walked across a conference room loomed over me and said I wanted to tell you that Ive been admiring you from a distance To which I replied well isnt that the only way you could Problem solved his crush was over

Just one more thing because I think this has been getting lost in the shuffle there is actual data out there about the impact shops have on communities and it reveals that shops are bad for communities for two reasons they correlate strongly with increased property crime and they trap people who dont have access to credit in cycles of shortterm debt that lead to longterm fiscal problems Are shops the end of the world or even the worst thing facing Crown Heights No of course not but crime and debt are serious issues and I told BobEugene as much when I spoke to him the data I reference is linked here as well Sure shops are legal though the jewelery store may still be a zoning violation in which case it is illegal but legal and moral are not the same thing

In the th century the first polar expeditions to the Arctic first reported weather and seaice observations from high latitudes to which expeditions from the th century onwards added instrumental measured data from both polar regions These early observations and meteorological data are essential to the investigation of climate change and global warming because the ice cover of land and sea in high latitudes is very sensitive to variations of temperature and other meteorological parameters Today these historic observations are used as proxy data for describing the climate of the past and the measured data are used as starting points for longterm evaluation

While some have bashed the film for following in the New Years EveValentines Day fashion there is one aspect that sets this film apart and that is the talent both behind and in front of the camera Director Kirk Jones Waking Ned Devine Nanny McPhee has displayed his knack for innovative humor then when you combine that with screenwriter Shauna Cross Whip It you can be rest assured that they will put this allstar cast to good use This film may not break any records however it is sure to use its star power to bring in fans looking for a few laughs in this predominately actionpacked summer While the trailer may not be as funny as one would expect I still have high hopes that this film will be a hit

What I take from this passage is that there is no reason to set rules around the path you feel you should be taking if you dont actually know where you are going We focus so strongly on what enculuration says is normal about the ways we get into relationships how we let off steam or how we respond to someone who has ticked us off for example that we stop looking at the why behind our actions

I quoted verses but right now there are only two verses I want to focus on verses two and five The nine verses are talking about the coming apostasy This is describing what the world will be like in the end times not only the world but more importantly the church We gather that from verse five where it says they have the form of godliness but denying the power of God It gives a list of qualities that are also in the church Verses two through four paints a very scary picture much of what we are seeing now days Only one has not come to pass but I will discuss that in another blog at another time The people have gone away from God to chase their own selfish desires They consider themselves devout Christians if they spend a couple of hours a week in church then the rest of the week they are chasing their own selfish desires Many who are gentiles claim to be christians out of ignorance

Nostradamus whos featured in the last two weekly Ends of the World here has also had a remarkable track record for inspiring false prophecies in others and Im not just thinking of the cheap tabloids that trot out newly manufactured prophecies with his name on them every few months Many Nostradamus researchers have embarrassed themselves once they moved from trying to forcefit quatrains onto the past and attempted to use the French prophets writings to anticipate the future

The Monroe Institute is a nonprofit education and research organization devoted to the exploration of human consciousness They have been studying consciousness for more than years In more recent years mainstream science has taken to studying consciousness people who meditate and how it affects them Just recently Massachusetts General Hospital released a report Benefits of Meditation in the Brain where they found that people who meditate actually have structural changes in their brains in as few as weeks and that changes in brain structure may underlie some of these cognitive and psychological improvements and that people are not just feeling better because they are spending time relaxing Pretty interesting stuff going on these days

Well Isabel and Ryans beloved Grams made her way to town this past Thursday and we wasted no time keeping her entertained We jetted off that night to bowl with my coworkers Theyre a fun sociable group that plans lots of these outings Usually I cant go with the kids on my own but with a second set of hands available to corral the kids I finally got to join in on the fun Luckily our group had the foresight and by foresight I mean there were no other lanes available so they got stuck with the end ones to get the lanes on the end right by the arcade area I say luckily because Isabel could run around over there and I could see her from the lanes pretty easily and just check on her occasionally without having to drag her back for me to bowl

To be holy is to be like God To be a Christian is to be holy But what does that mean We read the word of God and search and ponder and wonder about that perfection of heart and we see Christ The Lord Jesus Christ Have we left him as a babe in a manger or a sacrifice on a cross Or have we pulled back the curtains of our own human thinking and let the glorious beauty of his holiness penetrate our heart
Policywise the advantage of designing a social policy as social insurance is that it creates a certain element of independence from the party in power Programs that are funded through general taxation and the regular budgetary process can be defunded the moment that one party loses their majority and is replaced by the opposition and this is just as true of social policy as any other When a conservative majority gradually formed in Congress between and the s FDR saw many of his New Deal spending programs phased out with the significant exception of the Social Security system which didnt need Congressional appropriations thanks to its payroll taxdriven Trust Fund Similarly much of LBJs Great Society and War on Poverty programs were eliminated between the end of his presidency and the rise of Reagan again because many of those programs depended on Congressional appropriations for survival

Nirvana took a major gamble with their final album on which Kurt Cobain decided that the audience hed acquired by writing flawless scabrous pop songs was ready for the true measure of abrasion which festered inside his head He solicited the production acumen of Big Black alum Steve Albini the absolute last choice of the suits at DGC and proceeded to churn out the rawest music of his career the sound hed been searching for from the moment he first picked up a guitar When it was decided that the resulting tapes were too forbidding for mass consumption REM stalwart Scott Litt was brought in to salvage what little radiofriendliness could be had and the final product was a compromise for everyone involved Here Gillian Gaar exposes the intralabel strife that almost aborted In Utero before it could hit the market from the fights over artistic control and songwriting credit to the compromising position in which Cobain found himself after siring one of the most lucrative rock releases of the early s In spite of or because of the antagonism of which it was borne In Utero may well be Nirvanas greatest legacy a punishing treatise on the true cost of success

Acne is a complex beauty issue as it can be aggravated by many factors In my book I explain the different types of acne and their causes for example some break outs are caused by inflammation while others are caused by dehydration One thing I think is important is to know that acne is not simply caused by bacteria or clogged pores they are a symptom of some other imbalance

My point is that even if the Prince did these things or not it is now out in the public Even if Jonas did cheat or not it is still out in the public and the public point of view seems to matter a grate deal to royalties as royal decisions are often made to keep the myth of the ideal portrait in harmony Which I find tricky as the ideal of royalty is also quite a myth

Hilary Harris is a nearly forgotten avantgarde filmmaker though he won an Academy Award for best short subject in and is generally acknowledged as a pioneer of timelapse photography particularly for his admirable year timelapse vision of New York City Organism His earlier dance film Variations on a Dance Theme is even more obscure but its a potent examination of both the human form and of film form and how the aesthetics of the camera can interact with the human body The film is as simple and direct as its title suggests In a bare undecorated studio a young woman Bettie de Jong in a cloth leotard enacts a simple series of dance movements starting and ending in a reclining position on the wood floor and in between gracefully flowing through an elegant slowmotion set of pirouettes and fluid turns She repeats this dance nine times and each time Harris varies his filming methods to capture her movements in subtly different ways

The NFL Draft finally arrived Thursday night Round one wrapped up at Radio City Music Hall in New York It was first night of a three day selection extravaganza Millions of fans will tunein to get a glimpse of their teams future Take me for instance Im a diehard lifelong Miami Dolphins fan The future is all I have because typically the present is usually quite unattractive The annual draft is the equivalent of the playoffs for a team like mine It just comes with the added bonus of knowing that they wont get beat That was the final score of Dan Marinos last game a playoff debacle in Jacksonville It was so bad that it was also head coach Jimmy Johnsons last game The loss was so horrific that nothing Johnson would do after that could ever be more embarrasing Thats why it was so easy for him to transition into his roll as an Extenze spokesperson I know I have to let it go but like any true fan I cannot The bottom line is that optimism reigns supreme on a night like this Past losses and past failures take a back seat for a brief three day stretch

The Steps is an easy blend of different tones Hitchcocks shadows and great shots of shocked faces remind me of Langs style in M but the romance and light comedy punctuating the film keep it from getting too dark Though Hannays frustration at being the wrong man could have been as desperate as a Kafka characters he adapts to his new role well and even begins to have fun as he learns the ins and outs of the conspiracy Plus Hannay is a bit of a ladies man and being handcuffed to a pretty hardtoget blonde seems like his idea of a good time

I have denied my hippie roots to some extent during this illness buckling and having Rob pick up some Ibuprofen Theraflu and Chloraseptic when the vitamin C D and gargling with saltwater didnt seem to be doing enough I took Tylenol PM last night hoping to get some solid rest so that I could force myself to work on a proposal for public art Ive known about for a couple of weeks The deadline was pm today This elicited a last minute Maries chastising from Rob but to be fair I would have had it done much earlier had I not been struck down with sickness all week
This is another unique song for Pink Floyd its Roger Waters interpretation of a jazz number and its really catchy Hes not rated as a singer but I just love his voice its so individual and expressive I found myself this morning humming this tune and couldnt place it Then I thought ah Its that weird song from Meddle so I decided to do the review I was just reading on Wikipedia so Im not sure how accurate it is but apparently unlike the rest of the album which was created organically by Waters and Gilmour Waters wrote and recorded this himself and then Gimour added a little slide Wright the piano solo and Mason a couple of beats This is certainly not what youd expect from Pink Floyd but its great all the same

Those with fastheld religious views might see life in this world as suffering from which we want to escape or in other words a big NO Scientific materialists would see life as a material event scientifically unfolding but devoid of any purpose or meaning A big NEUTRAL But others see life as a big GOOD at a fundamental level That doesnt necessarily mean that everything that happens in life is good he writes Of course many things occur within the process that are tragic painful senseless and even evil But the essence of the experience is fundamentally good
In the last set of posts on God Encounters we looked at Jacob and his encounter with God His encounter came out of fear fear of an uncle who he thought wanted to kill him and fear of a brother who he thought wanted to kill him Jacob ended up trying to manipulate his way out of everything but then God showed up God showed up and wrestled with Jacob all night long Jacob held on tightly to God He would not let go and in that we see a picture of what we need to do We need to hold on and in be in Gods presence and allow Him to change us from manipulators to ministers Jacob had trouble on every side but God changed him God changed his heart and God even changed his name God encountered Jacob and Jacob held on till God made him let go by knocking his hip out of joint Jacob gladly left that encounter with God with a limp that reminded Him of who God was and how great God was God wants to do the very same for all of us

Social life with increase of wealth has a trend towards demoralization Luxury weakens morality Popular amusements become sensualized and offer their temptations to the church Do not be conformed to the world applies to the theater the ballroom the winecup and to everything that would turn Gods earth into a Vanity Fair Conformity to the world amounts in the end to more than the corruption of Christs church It puts out the light which Christ has kindled it destroys the very leaven which He has prepared to purify and sweeten and save a world lying in wickedness

Ive only known Steve a couple of months even though were both poets moving around in the same circles I went along last minute to a reading in Manchester and there he was this slightly tired but interesting looking fella with a woolly cap standing at the mic on a very wintry Manchester evening He started reading this poem called The Mills are Dead and for a number of reasons I tuned in more than I had been doing the rest of the evening It was something about his rich Rochdale accent there is something that says home to me about an accent like that And I love mills And his poem just spoke out to me that night It has a real grim sense of the closure of the mills and all the detail of a time and place that died with them

I doubt that there is much support for either of these assumptions and this adds to my growing feeling of unease that the diagnosis would become not much a a posthoc excuse employed by lawyers and defence teams as a means of excusing defendants behaviours and reducing sentences for In short it would add yet more unnecessary complexity to an already controversial system which many would argue is already clearly biased towards the defendants

The point in the video that Stallman makes is a good one Buying proprietary software to which you dont have access to the source code is like buying a house with a locked basement If you try to make repairs or improvements you need the help of the person with the key If they are unwilling or unable to give you help then you are stuck and have to move or live within their constraints
As this is a groundbreaking initiative we know there are lots of questions out there but youll appreciate that were creating a new model here which we believe will revolutionise the way people get published in the future What everyone knows for sure is that the current system is not working as a result the publishing industry is overly complicated elitist and inaccessible and even the top publishing houses are having to resort to publishing trashy celebrity novels to make ends meat rather than find those gems THAT WE KNOW EXIST OUT THERE

Confine your criticism to a specific act General criticism demoralizes people Its important not to make unrealistic demands Suggest small steps and ways to improve A good way to offer criticism to a miser would be Maybe this year you can give one percent more Increase the amounts little by little and soon the miser will turn into a generous donor It is forbidden to shame someone in public However if by remaining silent you will condone unethical behavior you may speak out In fact the gemara in Avodah Zarah says that if you dont rebuke a sinner you bear responsibility for the sin as well If someone is speaking lashon hara and circumstances make it difficult to stop him try to change the subject If that fails get up and leave

There was at least people there but possibly more than that for a weekday demonstration in Cardiff it is quite rare to see a demonstration of that size and the police were clearly stunned by the amount of people there and had to call for reinforcements although it must be said that the reinforcements brought the total number of police officers up to only four anyway so was a rather pointless exercise on there part and they clearly didnt have any control over the demonstration which was effectively stewarding itself

The soup is made to order meaning that the cheese is melted on top when the order is placed I waited a short time and Marty brought me my soup Somehow as I wasnt paying attention I knocked the spoon off the plate onto the floor but luckily Marty was right there and handed me a spoon from his shirt pocket As I looked around I noticed the other waiters had spoons in their pockets Id never seen this before so I asked Marty why they all have spoons in their shirt pockets Marty told me the owner Bruce makes them carry the spoons around because people are always dropping the spoons off the saucers and its just quicker to have a spoon with you to replace the fallen one I thought that made good sense

When listening to the podcast you will also notice when Karl says something vaguely humorous or outrageous Ricky will do a very overthetop laugh This might even be something you would have noticed if youve heard the guys on the radio before or seen them on TV What Karl says is usually funny anyway but Rickys laughter subconsciously makes you want to laugh out loud too take this from someone who was listening to this podcast on a coach to London desperately trying to suppress laughter to avoid looking weird to other passengers

I keep thinking back to the comment Franois Truffaut made in about being too young when he made Jules and Jim If hed made it at any other age it wouldnt be the same movie and probably wouldnt hold the same appeal for so many Granted critics of an older age appreciated and praised the film at its release but for Jules and Jim to grab you really grab you and maintain that grip over the years I think you need to be young when you see it the first time and thats why Truffaut not yet but captivated by the novel since had to be young as well I found this clip on YouTube and knew I had to include it Its the great actor John Hurt extolling the virtues of Jules and Jim and what an impression it made on him He was when it opened

Flanagans essay approaches the question of class and the reaction to Amy Chua through the lens of the admissions processes in Ivy Leaguecaliber universities She conjures for us the image of the good mother the professional class woman who has cut back on her career aspirations in order to nurture her children into the world The good mother Flanagan writes has certain ideas about how success is life is achieved These ideas are built around the notion that if they deeply support a childs natural talent the rest will fall into place

Lost in the Hillary RosenAnn Romney flap with a side of Bill Maher thrown in for good measure is what Mitt Romneys position has been when the subject of the debate wasnt his wife A video has surfaced of Mitt Romney discussing his view of welfare earlier this year before the upcoming New Hamsphire primary Its easy to locate on major media sites and probably YouTube so I suggest you should watch the entire exchange The short version is that he believes that those who are going to accept aid from the government federal or state should in return be required to take a job so that they can share in the dignity of work And of course intentionally or not hes suggesting requiring unemployed mothers to get a job since they comprise the vast majority of welfare recipients

A lot of people find it hard to be comfortable on their own which is okay too but at the same time I feel that its good for people to learn to be comfortable in their own company To imagine things to read or watch a film to give themselves some time and space to sit and reflect Our society is all about fast things technology everyone seems to be on the go and it feels sometimes as though people have forgotten the value of slowing down taking time to think and be more creative I like the hours when everyone is asleep and I can read or write or write blog posts like this one When I can reflect and the illusion of a sleeping world is complete Even though I know that other people are awake in other parts of the world for me this feels like quiet reflection this is what introversion gives me I dont always feel as though I have to fill every part of my day with something busy and noisy I like silence even though I love to communicate too

Barca made a single change in selling unhappy Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who had replaced Etoo after the season and bringing in Spanish star David Villa to replace him alongside Messi They also sold Henry who was unhappy about his lack of playing time However there were doubts about how the moves would work out for Barca With Etoo and Ibrahimovic Barca had bigger bodied strikers who played close to the goal and focused on putting the ball in the net They were an ideal complement to Messi a playmaking wizard who liked to play a little further from the net to give him space for his dynamic penetrating runs With Villa they had another smaller quick playmaking striker While not of the caliber of Messi who is without doubt the worlds greatest player he is still a top five striker

I was released from hospital a day early on Christmas Eve days after I was first admitted but I was under doctors orders to get the babys weight checked the next day on Christmas Day because she was still losing weight and I was breast feeding and supplementing with formula We had her checked daily for the next while and she kept losing weight Finally I got too worried to keep breast feeding and I decided to switch to directly feeding formula only For the next day or so she still only drank the amount of formula she was drinking when I was trying to breast feed which tells me she wasnt getting much of anything when I was trying to breast feed I finally managed to increase her formula intake and her weight started to creep up She had gotten down to below lbs She still isnt the greatest eater in the world and not everyone can make her eat at all But we are working it out together and she is at least gaining weight now She is up to lbs I am so proud of her She sleeps almost all the time sometimes even taking her bottle in her sleep She has a full head of dark curly hair and we still cant make out what color her eyes are I am leaning towards hazel or steel gray I wish there was a eye color specialist who could look at them and give us a definitive answer as hers seem to change depending on the light She hates getting baths but loves cuddling She is slightly over a month and lifts her head smiles at you and even giggles in her sleep which is the cutest thing you have ever seen

Poverty causes credit constraints This stops the poor investing in businesses or education the low aspirations caused by poverty can have the same effect Inequality can create the threat of redistribution which can blunt incentives to invest Or it can lead to state interventions such as the minimum wage that harm wealth creation The backlash against wealthcreating processes such as globalization offshoring and private equity in the UK and US are founded in the view that they create inequality If we had better redistribution mechanisms say a basic income such backlashes would be reduced and the wealth creation process enhanced source

This spot could have gone to MasterChef Australia which should now totally be called Adult MasterChef Australia just to make it sound creepy but Junior MasterChef had more likeable contestants it didnt clog up the schedule with nonstop hour coverage and its food looked just as spectacular Even for those viewers who complained about the supposed meanness of MasterChef would find it hard to fault the grade schoolers of Junior MasterChef The only downside hating reality show contestants is a signature of the genre but hating on kids feels kind of mean even if they deserve it

Now after that you would not think that I would have had room to try anything else but when I saw the list of deserts on the menu I had to give it a try anyway You can choose between a slice of their homemade pecan pie or a bowl of their peach or blackberry cobbler and have a scoop of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream added on top of any of them I opted for the pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream The pie it self was pretty good but not the best I have ever had I think the consistency was a little off for me Instead of being gooey like a pecan pie should be it had more of a pumpkin pie consistency to it which I wasnt really expecting But the flavor was spot on and when you add the ice cream nothing else seemed to matter

In the early days of the s and s before the trains came in Coney Island wasnt a place for day trippers The two attractions were a the enormous resort hotels like the Manhattan Beach the Brighton Beach and the Oriental where families would stay for their vacations by the sea And b several racetracks where people would come bet on horses which I conclude without making any value judgments explains the nearby presence of many wild saloons And in the early days of Coney Island variety performers would entertain in these two kinds of venues the very genteel hotels and the very wild saloons

In compelling the bishop by legal proceedings to grant institution the form known as Duplex Querula was adopted which consisted of a complaint tendered to the archbishop against his Ordinary for some alleged denial of justice The Dean of Arches Sir H J Fust issued a monition to the bishop to institute Mr Gorham within fifteen days or show cause for refusing institution to be proceeded with by default The bishop responded by what is called an Act on Petition in which he included the book published by Mr Gorham containing a detailed account of his examination The bishop expressed himself convinced that Mr Gorham was of unsound doctrine in respect to the efficacy of the Sacrament of Baptism inasmuch as he held that spiritual regeneration is not given or conferred in that Holy Sacrament This elicited a defensive rejoinder from Mr Gorham The case came on for hearing in the Arches Court in February and judgment was given in the following August in favour of the bishop Sir H J Fust concluded his judgment by stating that the doctrine of the Church of England undoubtedly is that children baptized are regenerated at baptism and are undoubtedly saved if they die without committing actual sin Mr Gorham has maintained and does maintain opinions opposed to that Church of which he professes himself a member and a minister

Vincents Blue Caps rocked raw more desperately than anyone listen again to Cliff Gallups outrageous solos on the overfamiliar Be Bop A Lula Its an incredibly record Buddy Holly had melodic romantic nous and Little Richard had ontheline freak energy but neither made a record that was as intense and panting as Be Bop A Lula Gene cant wait to tell us about what hes got Shes the gal in the red blue jeans queen of all the teens clearly a looker then he sings shes the woman that I know From gal to woman in one verse With that carnal clue the song pauses followed by an untamed unplanned shriek from the drummer This and the prophetic breakneck Race With The Devil were both recorded at Vincents debut studio session unsociable and ferocious these early recordings are very hard to beat

As I mention earlier some of the most interesting parts of The Beautiful Cigar Girl beyond the stories of the Rogers and Poe are the many insights into the period From the virtual nonexistence of an actual police force in NYC at the time to the dozens of newspapers each one shamelessly and blatantly editorializing the story of the murder to push its own agenda If you think the news media is pretty bad today and dont get me wrongit is wait until you hear what it was like in when newspaper editors used the story of an innocent girls death not only to sell papers but to destroy the careers of political enemies

Imagine a situation in which all a countrys citizens earned the minimun wage and there was full employment If the government raised the minimum wage there would be no greater supply or quantity demanded for goods or services therefore no wealth has been created People would have more money but it would cost companies more to purchase the labor to produce goods and services Thus to companies will have to choose to either accept earning less income or raise prices This example shows how minimum wage is increased by acts of Congress and decreased as inflation erodes purchasing power

It seems like the ten million could have been better spent on things that would be more helpful to society If they want to spend money on art why not fund art programs in the schools Wouldnt the money be better spent in developing businesses with long range plans of creating jobs and recycling more money into the economy Arent there plenty of people and organizations that would be more benefited by this money than a big giant rock

After consuming a reasonable fried breakfast at some faceless motorway service station I arrived in Lincoln at am Lincoln is a small city that fits the quaint description but theres two sites that you need to make time for Lincoln Cathedral looks awesome from the front its just like any other cathedral on the inside mind but worth a mooch just for the stylish wood carvings depicting the Twelve Stations of the Cross The second sight is the castle which is a two minute walk from the cathedral This place held more historical interest for me it used to be a former womens prison and is still used as a county court But the jewel in its crown is that it holds an original Magna Carta and I was eager to give this important document a butchers Unfortunately I found out that the original charter was away on tour and replaced with a copy similar to the one thats displayed in in the cathedral AWAY ON TOUR Now why didnt they tell me this in the first place However the surrounding exhibition more than made up for the disappointment and also on display is the ancient Charter of the Forest not a facsimile written on animal skin and dating from this was still in use up until making it the longest remaining statute that was in force in England The explanation of how both charters came into existence is simple to understand beautifully well presented and therefore an ideal day out for children I was in my element

Hosley joins his Virginia Tech teammate David Wilson in New York He has a lot of potential to be a star He lead the nation in interceptions two years ago however his production dropped down last season considerably Another problem with Hosley is that he failed a drug test at the scouting combine but the Giants felt his talent made him worth the risk The Giants already have three good cornerbacks on their roster including Corey Webster Terrel Thomas Prince Amukamara He could see a starting role as the punt returner Jerry Reese seems confident in his pick He is not a big man but this guy has athletic arrogance and plays like a big guy general manager Jerry Reese said He kind of reminds me of Adam Jones he plays kind of like that He runs like a little linebacker He has outstanding cover skills We expect him to be in our nickel package and the bonus is he returns punts and kicks He has a lot of good qualities that we like

Eventually most of those people who are led captive by the sins of comfort will die in captivity A few will survive and be liberated during the battle of Armageddon The ones who will be liberated will be the next generation that grew up in captivity The ones who put their faith and trust in God and nothing else The ones who did not enjoy the wicked media the ones who did not go into debt because they were filled with greed to live above their means The ones who found their joy in the Lord instead of the materialism of this world Their job after Armageddon will be to bear witness to what happened So the world can remember it and move on with life to make sure sins and crimes such as these will not be committed ever again They will bear witness to what God did for them and their testimony will live on and God will be given the glory for everything

Many novels are wellwritten but a bit boring Many more are thrilling and badly written Some like this one are fascinating and nailbiting and also satisfy on a sentence by sentence basis The most impressive thing about this book is its architecture the clever way its constructed and assembled but its also gossipy funny full of hairraising accounts of terrible things and like the very best of Dickens itll make you gasp and make you cry while giving you a few laughs along the way It is also satisfactorily fat so it will entertain you for longer than one sitting I cant recommend it highly enough

definite rules for the size and proportion of places cannot be laid down They should bear some relation to the size of the buildings likely to surround them An overlarge place will tend to dwarf buildings Sitte points out also that tall buildings narrow in proportion to their height such as the west ends of cathedrals seem to require places deep in the dimension at right angles to their front while wide buildings of lesser height such as are many town halls picturegalleries and the north and south fronts of cathedrals seem on the other hand to show best on places wide in the direction parallel to the building and shallow in the direction at right angles to it He also recommends that places should not usually be square but rather oblong the length and the width bearing some definite proportion one to the other Usually the length should not be greater than three times the width

There were several babies that crawled over to where I was standing reaching up to me I quickly grabbed two of them one for each arm A few minutes later one of the Ugandan women that worked there yelled at me No Put them down Confused and hurt I promptly set them back down on the ground Screaming and crying they looked up at me again reaching up wanting to be held It was an awful feeling and I began to cry with them I was able to hold myself together and choke back most of the tears but I felt so helpless Later one of the women told me that they dont want the babies to rely on being held So I did as the mamas were doing and sat down on the ground My lap was then swarmed like the beach at Normandy I tried to interact with them by rubbing their backs and holding their hands One of them fell asleep in my lap and the same happened to my husband Melting again We kept exchanging awkward looks Like what the are we supposed to be doing right now Believe me Im used to chaos I think I mentioned that I have something like nieces and nephews just on my side but this was different I felt so overwhelmed

Till then the many organs of Zion which infest the net some sites and blogs that many selfproclaimed nationalist sites link to gnash their teeth in rage vent their spleen and generally rail against the decision to take down the Zionist Defence Leagues website For us we real Europeans we caught up within this contrived clash of civilisations for us it may help to know that at least one angry gentile one angry individual may be saved from the manipulation of Zionists Of course we must realise that this is but one small setback for malignancy one small wound in the belly of the great beast and in any event the jury is out as to whether they have done their job and their presence is still needed Personally I believe that they have much poison to sow much hatred to augment and much subversion to partake in

Once the driver is no longer traction limited out of a turn they can engage KERS Usually a few small s boosts out of critical turns provides the ideal lap time Its the driver who has to control the duration of the boost by whichever control As with gear shift the drivers can be uncannily accurate in their apportioning of the boost around the lap Its suggested that the Ferrari system apportioned the duration of the KERS boost via a GPS map the driver simply presses the button and the electronics gives them the predetermined amount of boost This solution came as surprise to Andy Cowell so one wonders if this is legal or perhaps if the report is true

I liked this one It may not be in my top ten but I liked it It was not too much of typical mystery except for the Agatha Christie type gathering at the end that made the murder do something desperate I liked Emma the local island celebrity mystery writer who helps Annie But most of all I liked that it was a mystery that didnt center too much on blood and gore graphic or lots of foul language I guess this is what they call a cozy mystery and I can see why they have become popular I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery that is not too drawn out

My only problem with Code Name Verity is that perhaps because of its epistolary format the entire thing has been written down starting with Verity in prison sometimes it became too much a narrative and too little actual interaction between characters As a result I found it dragged simply because I was waiting for something to happen especially in the beginning My other minor complaint is the very ending of the novel which is written by a character that hadnt been important at all and so felt a bit jarring and unnecessary in a way

Try telling them it isnt necessary stop fiddling with what isnt broken Ah but you know you cannot argue with machines armed with computer generated stats promising profit for economic innovation Have you ever tried to contact blogger for tech support Where are the people the human beings wearing ear pieces and mouth mics to fix your foibles We shouldnt wonder what happened to the human personality that used to be so gracious Once autobots replaced the human being your query into tech support in ANY situation no longer encouraged or required courtesy Once you figured out you could pay your bills by cellphone online or just by authorizing creditors to trawl your bank account you didnt have to write legibly either Mostly we learned to check boxes and copypaste the rest How encouraging are conversations with other voices where you respond with only yes or no and hang up on them Every one of us is at least guilty of that That is what they want These antisocial actions only create more of the same antisocial behaviors If we are willing to cooperate this much how much more will we cooperate with before signing out for the last time Are we even close Remotely close Some will be more than happy to go away and do something else something real something that does not lead to ennui Believe it or not there is still a beautiful world out there we will never find it the longer we stay glued to this unnatural relationship

The feeble attempts of Darwinian antiscience to prove a chain of development from the lowest forms of life to the highest is seriously flawed by its materialist cultlike philosophy The progress they seek from the lowest animated matter to the highest form of life is full of gaps and gaffs Missing links are hailed for their discovery and quietly forgotten when proved false Darwinian pseudoscience continues in its duplicity however despite the facts and its critics It is a futile attempt to portray man as ascending by his own nature to the throne of God For although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened Romans ESV

Meanwhile the Environmental Protection Agency is frantically issuing new rules and regulations to reduce the CO emissions from utilities and manufacturing facilities before the public realizes that its actual goal is to kill the US economy by increasing the cost of electricity and everything else It is insanely trying to shut down the mining of coal while other elements of the Obama regime are trying to stop any drilling for oil

This crazy parrothaving place I landed in could not be more different than where I lived for the entirety of three decades When I think of trying to put down into words how it makes me feel to to see a palm tree in my peripheral vision I go numb Which is crazy its just a palm tree What could be so fabulous and compelling about a palm tree that I cannot manage to convey its impact in writing The issue isnt the tree itself its the unexpectedness of it Its purely foreign to me A palm tree to a girl who always lived in Tennessee is an exotic thing It is a large looming figure of otherness an iconic beast that exists in postcards and at the movies and on vacation Never when you are walking the dog So when I see it out of the corner of one eye my chest brims with the thrill of not just something new but a regular something new Something different from what always was and I can see it whenever I want I just walk outside

Ive gone on in the past about how man used to be neutral wif indicated female and vir indicated male And what continues to bug me is that while man became malespecific language did not shift to maintain common use of a neutral term so that now we end up with a modern English whose euphony still likes to be able to refer to all people with a single syllable but whose supposedlyneutral term is blatantly genderreferential Lets be very clear this is not a womanonly issue oh look I just realised what the next short post will be about This is a legitimately egalitarian thing treating man as generic both exoticisesmarginalises women and it generifies men contributing to the idea that men are not special not important et cetera

Author Summary The narrowsense heritability of a trait such as bodymass index is a measure of the variability of the trait between people that is accounted for by their additive genetic differences Knowledge of these genetic differences provides insight into biological mechanisms and hence treatments for diseases Genomewide association studies GWAS survey a large set of genetic markers common to the population They have identified several single markers that are associated with traits and diseases However these markers do not seem to account for all of the known narrowsense heritability Here we used a recently developed model to quantify the genetic information contained in GWAS for single traits and shared between traits We specifically investigated metabolic syndrome traits that are associated with type diabetes and heart disease and we found that for the majority of these traits much of the previously unaccounted for heritability is contained within common markers surveyed in GWAS We also computed the genetic correlation between traits which is a measure of the genetic components shared by traits We found that the genetic correlation between these traits could be predicted from their phenotypic correlation

Psalm 
Many believe that following Jesus with our heads and our hearts alone are enough But true faith will be evident in changed behavior All too often though we cling to our comfort and ease even at the cost of our walk with God It is so easy for us to become consumed with our personal success in life We believe its all about wise choices making good moves and approval of those around us We measure our greatness in terms of worldly success But in Gods eyes our greatness is measured in how we express our concern for others especially in those who cannot pay us back the helpless the needy and the poor

Seasonings or aromatics are used both in the brine and roasted inside the cavity of the bird Since only the essence of the seasonings is small enough to pass through the skin and into the meat your options are wide open Whole spices and fresh herbs are excellent for brining No additional salt is needed but try things like fresh peppercorns allspice berries cloves rosemary sage thyme garlic or ginger Apples and citrus fruits make great additions to the brine

Whats amazing about Look Back in Anger is how autobiographical it purportedly is John Osborne the playwright was also notoriously horrible to his loved ones after repeatedly insulting her he threw his teenage daughter out of the house and never spoke to her again Like Jimmy Porter the cruelty of his language was infamous And whats amazing is that someone so well selfinvolved and could have been able to write anything remotely threedimensional at all Its a wonder he managed to create characters other than Jimmy Porter especially Jimmys longsuffering wife Alison and friend Cliff

As the warmer days of spring and summer approach nothing hits the spot like a glass of ice tea or lemonade I actually love to mix the two together because I find it gives a sweet and tart balance that is amazing This time I decided to get creative and threw in some fresh strawberries for flavor and a gorgeous color to make this festive StrawberryLemon Iced Tea As a Sri Lankan a good quality tea is a must have in any household My favorite brand of tea is Aura brand of Ceylon Teas by Almar Teas Aura makes strawberry and lemon flavored teas that are delicious So I took a little help from them by using their flavored teas and enhancing it with some fresh lemon juice and strawberries It may be hot outside but with a refreshing glass of this tea you can relax and actually feel good your are drinking something full of vitamins and antioxidant

If you do much outdoor photography Id recommend getting some polarizing filters early on especially before youre really comfortable doing postprocessing on your images They can give your image a punch and give you some control that you might otherwise be lacking under a lot of shooting conditions You can tame glare and reflections saturate your colors better and more evenly across the whole scene and tamp down the risk of losing shots because they end up way too washed out or ruined by haze I cant wait to get out with mine and experiment some more Just remember to take them off before you try and do any indoornighttimedim light shots

Each bite was delicious filled with gooey cheese covered spicy chicken The bread wasnt overcooked but perfectly done it having soaked up the excess wing sauce The chicken didnt dry out between having seared and then baking it and it too soaked up the wing sauce The sauce itself was still spicy leaving my lips tingling and my eyes watering only slightly even after it had cooled off completely And it wasnt until I had a handful of bites until I was done but I got the idea to try it with BBQ sauce It is a chicken calzone isnt it It was the perfect marriage of flavours honestly Tangy smoky barbecue with spicy chicken and cheese While eating it inspired a new recipe that I will have to write down before it evades me

There are big agents and small agents Your agent may be one of many in a large agency and this can be useful as they are likely to have expert departments to deal with things such as foreign rights TV and film rights and so on They also have a lot of clout in the publishing world The downside is that they will have much bigger fish than you in their pond and you might feel neglected A small agent may be a onewoman band or one of two or three agents in a quaint dusty booklined office in Soho thats my agents dusty Soho office in the photo They may have less detailed knowledge may not handle foreign rights themselves and have fewer fingers to have in pies but at the same time youll be a larger fish in their pond and get more of their time and attention

Two broad theories have been proffered in explanation The first is that the conflict was engendered and continually stoked by a governmentbacked third force which sought thereby to destabilise the ANC The second recognises the brutalities of apartheid and the methods used to maintain it but posits that many or perhaps even most of the deaths arose in the context of the peoples war
The evidence shows that when a government tries to raise taxes on job creators they either move their business to where tax rates are lower or they grin and bear it and cut costsand that means jobs lost

Since this is a s Western its a foregone conclusion that Brennan will triumph but its a fun ride getting through the rest of the movie because Boetticher and his crew throw in several interesting twists The key character here for me is Usher who isnt a onedimensional bad guy Under normal circumstances he and Brennan could have been friends Usher treats his uneducated henchmen with contempt while engaging in meaningful conversation with Brennan about his dreams of having a ranch of his own As played by the charismatic Boone Usher comes off a sympathetic and even likeable villain something of an oddity in a Hollywood film of that era

We dug and we dug and we dug After what seemed like a week we had excavated maybe one fourth of this massive root The flock literally tried everything we knew to kill off this plant As a last resort we snuck into the Garden Center and made off with a bottle of something that is designed to kill stumps Mel borrowed a large drill from the shop guys here at Hillermanns and we drilled many holes in the gigantic root Into these holes we poured this stump killing formula and then we waited It took weeks but at long last the leaves keeled over and the massive horseradish was pronounced eradicated

So many thanks to Pinterest I tried some new activities with my kids this year that I hope to continue next year So I made the earth cupcakes split white cake batter in half add blue and green food coloring and then alternate pouring into the cupcake trays with a spoon They were very yummy The only problem I ran into was the humidity in my classroom today actually caused the red hearts I iced on top to literally melt away So by the time the kids got them it looked like something died on top I wont do this part next year Definitely a learn by doing experience

I started this paper mache project a few weeks ago when there was just so much going on in the house that I could not find a solid block of time in which to paint After searching the internet for paper mache recipes and ideas I settled on trying to make some pomegranates and a bowl It was a glorious mess a sticky doughy pasty papery floury mess all over the kitchen I started with packing newsprint and wadded it into then taped the paper together with masking tape Then I cut toilet paper tubes for the crowns and taped them on the The paper mache recipe includes toilet paper joint compound flour water glue and salt It had the texture and look of a crab dip And it stuck to my hands and fingers like a crab dip would But it was really fun to make such a mess For the bowl and the bird which I havent finished yet I used paper strips first then the joint compound mixture on top of that When everything was thoroughly dry I gessoed and painted the bowl and the fruit then finished it all with a couple coats of Mod Podge My friend Katie saw the project before anything was painted and made two suggestions One was to use a little bit of gold paint to add a glint and I could not for the life of me remember the second suggestion But Im sure it was good Anyhow I did edge some of the crowns with gold and the seeds are edged as well Hard to see in the photos but it was a great suggestion Katie thank you
I dont keep a traditional art journal as such but tend to rip half sheets of watercolour paper and collage over them in the wee small hours of the night They then get signed and dated and added to an ever growing collection of pages which I keep in handmade covers It makes for an interesting hour or three when I pull them off the shelf and peruse

An effective response to the violations of the rights of LBGTI people has to be more nuanced than the mere imposition of donor sanctions The history of colonialism and sexuality cannot be overlooked when seeking solutions to this issue The colonial legacy of the British Empire in the form of laws that criminalize same continues to serve as the legal foundation for the persecution of LGBTI people throughout the Commonwealth In seeking solutions to the multifaceted violations facing LGBTI people across Africa old approaches and ways of engaging our continent have to be stopped New ways of engaging that have the protection of human rights at their core have to recognize the importance of consulting the affected

Cooking the rack was super easy You could follow any rack of lamb recipe but I found I underestimated on oven time First I cut the rack in two then sealed both pieces on all sides with some butter and oil in a pan Then I popped them both into a hot oven C for minutes Because the layer of fat on the rack was so thick the mutton turned out very rare so when it came to carving the rack I popped each cutlet into the pan for a few seconds each side

Throughout his constitutional writings Anastaplo argues that the freedom of a selfgoverning people depends above all on their recognition that freedom is secured by selfdiscipline and by a selfimposed restraint that looks beyond mere selfinterest Modern no less than ancient political communities are defined by their shared view of justice and happiness In pursuit of happiness the ancients looked to politics to promote virtue Modern constitutionalism looks to virtue in the form of discipline and moderation to secure equality and rights and to protect free republican politics
I feel like fighting discrimination often places the fighter in the role of being a victim That is the essence of the thing someone done me wrong and I want to change the world so they cannot do it again In that role one is powerless and hoping to gain power While discrimination fighters have accomplished great things I feel like I want to act in a more immediately positive way in my own life That means I support the fight against discrimination but I choose a path where I am accepted because that make me feel ok right now

Like Mikls Jancss The RoundUp a recognisable historical setting is used to explore a series of contemporary concerns The village of the title becomes a metaphor for America in the shadow of fearful and hermetic fuelled by scaremongering and propaganda tactics that impose order conformity and control The monsters that breach the periphery of this prisonasvillage manifestation are representations of a society so blinded by pious selfrighteousness that they fail to recognise violence and resentment as inherently human traits In doing so these characters effectively initiate their own downfall but refuse to acknowledge it as anything less than a personal utopia

There is a theory that by normalising suffering and emphasising the universal nature of it religions comfort us with the knowledge that we are not alone True happiness is impossible in this lifetime we can only hope for a nicer afterlife The trouble with this theory is how readily it lends itself to keeping people in misery whilst telling them that its good for them Compassionate sharing is one thing oppression another and there are times when its not easy to see what youve got

The uprising of various districts seemed a natural place to take the storyline after the first book and I am glad Collins chose to give focus to it I actually felt like the limited POV of Katniss helped in this case It allowed us as viewers to experience the wonder of what was happening in the rebellion along with Katniss We were only given small details throughout the book and this helped build the suspense

Wheat beers should be drunk with the yeast in I find this adds a richness to the feel of the beer and gives it a thicker more velvety texture When served from a bottle in Germany the beer will be poured almost completely into the glass before the last few drops are swirled around the bottom of the bottle to pick up as much of the sediment as possible this is then thrown in too When pouring its also important to be quite aggressive you want to create a big pillow of head to sit on top of the beer
What is supposed to happen is the parts that are received into the store against a job card are to be placed into their relevant tub in the workshop immediately The leading hand is then to periodically check the tubs to see if all the items have arrived according to the requisition and if they have then they can then appoint the job to one of the trades people Because these jobs arent a priority they have been put back again and again until they have been somewhat forgotten

GINGRICH Does it contemplate that some day we could have a rocket My point in the speech I made yesterday which is on CSPAN and Id love to have all of you look at it Its based on having looked at space issues since the late s when missiles and rockets was a separate magazine And working with NASA and others I believe by the use of prizes by the use of incentives by opening up the space port so that its available on a ready basis for commercial fight by using commonsense for example the AtlasV could easily be fixed into a man capable vehicle so you didnt have to rely on on a Russian launch or a Chinese launch

Do You Read Me 
Honestly speaking I havent given much thought to praising this third book of the Caster Chronicles based on its first few chapters All the way down through the middle parts I have always told myself of how I find it boring me already and losing its spark Perhaps because I thought since this was already the third release and the authors have already ran out of ideas and plots for the story Basically I cant help but compare the events to the former ones that somehow it already looks like the same plot over and over again only that this time it is in a different package the same visions dreams kelting prophecies shadowing songs moons bindings and a whole lot more caster businesses that only readers of the book could understand Lol

Back when my little gal was just a toddler we purchased a GunVault Handgun Safe Aside from a gun holstered on us we felt it was a good compromise to keep a loaded gun ready for use while keeping it secure from a child The NoEyes keypad is easy to operate in the dark or without looking and the brief delay to get the firearm in hand is worth the security of keeping it out of hands it shouldnt be in Our little gal is now sixteen and has access to firearms for selfprotection in our home a point which will probably be discussed in further depth as part of a future post

It was a ridiculously picture perfect day the sun shined so brightly the sky a cartoonish blue complete with such fluffy cotton clouds as those crudely shaped by a child unselfconscientiously wielding an ample supply of chalk and a soft breeze blew which I very much remember thinking of as delicious I have always had a thing for wind which combined with the tweeting of myriad birds and the waves lapping against the rocks seemed the most delightful cacophony of sights and sounds as we sat on the rock looking out onto the river I felt consciously content happy

Commissioned in White is a lighthearted short novel in the Art of Love series It ties up some of the loose ends from the first three installments while providing a taste of what is to come in books five and six It begins where Captured in Ink left offa few short weeks prior to Jessica and Wills wedding We experience Jessicas fear of getting married after being single for so long and how she tries to cope with that fear through the use of medication on the happy day The end result was an entertaining ceremony if nothing else We also delve more into Reesa and Shanes abrupt marriage While adjusting the house to accommodate one more person Reesa finds her tenyear old wedding dress and feels sad that she never got to wear it after all those years The dresss existence gets out and there is talk of having a wedding after the fact so she can wear it Reesa rejects the idea until her bestie Jillian convinces her otherwise This wedding however ends slightly differently from the other Larson weddings in that the groom not the bride flips out Shane nearly faints and nearly rips Reesas dress from her body as he goes down Reesa also realizes just how much Shane does love her and breaks out of her cocoon getting a tattoo and piercings to match her husbands On a lesser note Carrie learns that her birth control is not effective against a Larson man Brooke and Drake continue to spar with one another while Jillian fights the attraction between her and Joseph

I really enjoyed todays meditation It was back to basics being aware and present in the moment so important And it lasted only a minute or two And then setting your intention I think this is always important to actually set my intention but in a busy life sometimes it is the last thing I do when it should be the first Maybe I will try starting each day with that just setting my intention I mean how can the universe provide if I myself dont even know what it is I am looking for in the most basic sense

I will take a small pause outside of my usual KFD banter herehonestly I cant find anything funny or witty to say about this incident because two weeks later it STILL angers me to the core and brings me to near tears to think about that night as I cannot imagine ANY situation whatsoever that I would NOT let a woman in labor take a taxi at night during a snowstormnone The fact that I found TWO sets of people within minutes of each other who had no problems doing this makes it really hard for me not to question the quality of people in this area or make huge generalizations about Parisians I will try and do neither but suffice it to say we are moving to Montreuil in February and no one could be happier to say au revoir to tourist central Paris than me OK back to it

This last paragraph comes the closest to telling me the gist of the story but it should be expanded to the size of the whole query and should absorb pieces of but not all of the paragraphs above it The skeleton of the story here is that two people need to find the same guyGrandpa Henryfor different reasons and they come together to make that happen But we dont learn this information until the last paragraph and by that point you seem to be wrapping up
Why I liked it Astonishingly realistic characters populate an inspiring story with short chapters That format and the clear straightforward writing help to make a difficult subject easy to handle Auggie doesnt really have special needs Hes just different You never know that much about his face other than that his eyes are too far down and he doesnt exactly have ears People are shocked when they first see him The mean kids compare him to Gollum or ET or an orc But Auggies used to it

I have no idea how to judge a good acupuncture clinic from a bad one Although I think theres something to it possibly Im not way into alternative medicine Given the time constraints I didnt exactly have time to do a lot of research either My due date is days from today And I went days early with Miss M I called one place the woman is also a doula so I felt good about her and the woman is out of town I called a second place a place with a fancy address and a pile of staff who have very impressive pedigrees and they had someone available tomorrow afternoon So I went with that one The guy who will be doing it graduated from a year Chinese medical program and has written actual research papers on using socalled Eastern medicine to complement western medicine Hopefully that makes him qualified to burn some herbs near my toes

 The Town of Orleans has spent over million in taxpayer funds on WrightPierce for consulting services WP has developed a CWMP that calls for increasing the discharge of effluent at TT from gpd to gpd Despite stacks of reports and reams of paper the Towns consultant has never compiled a summary statement of the likely groundwater impacts of this effluent and freshwater load on Namskaket The record reveals a complete disregard for these valid environmental and financial concerns The WP evaluation of the hydrogeology at the TT plant siting has been a sham of misinformation dissembling and intentional obfuscation The CCGPF directly attributes this pattern of activity to Mike Giggey the Towns consulting engineer

But making our schools healthier isnt just about what happens in the kitchen As Norah said its also about what kids learn in the classroom And thats why were also encouraging you to do things like put on cooking demonstrations teach kids how to prepare meals at home You can help start a cooking club work with the teacher to integrate food into the lesson plan like theyve done at Murch or help students plant a garden if possible All that stuff is a part of it Its not just about the work in the kitchen
The dress below is from Dahlia on ASOS in the sale and its the prettiest thing ever Apologies for the bad lighting the weather has been truly awful gale force winds so Ive not been able to snap a pic outside for you guys yet The contrast material in black makes this dress super flattering As much as I love Dahlia I would definitely be hesitant to purchase this at full price which was originally on Asos however I know they mark it up a little from the actual Dahlia website just because of the quality of the material It IS very lovely though and I cant wait to wear it with thick tights cardigans and then bare legged in the Summer

How can we get original thought on the prayermeeting topics Only by study of the Bible followed by meditation and observation First the Endeavorer should read the Bible passage then he should read some good commentary upon it then he should take the subject with him into his daily life for five or six days thinking about it in his odd minutes and watching for experiences in his own life or the lives of others or of observing nature and looking for illustrations on the subject from all these sources

So for Im doing it again Yes I did order components for albums One of those sets will be my album The other are for the extra pictures that I still have in a box If I can get them in albums and then add the journaling I will actually be caught up on scrapbooking That would never happen with the way I use to scrapbook
With the evolution of BSEs conceptual backgrounds comes a pleasant evolution regarding their sound and approach as well While this is not to say that their previous albums were necessarily bad in any way there were at times certain elements to their songs which could arguably detract andor lessen the impact they would have otherwise had Specifically I am referring to the slightly awkward samples found on Pursuit Of Pleasure and the somewhat hitormiss rhythms of The Dull Routine Of Existence However it is difficult to conclusively state that these small nagging points are anything more than personal preferences especially since they display an admirable willingness for BSE to experiment evolve and maintain a unique musical aesthetic Regardless of these concerns No Lights In Our Eyes is much more minimalist in construction then their previous albums approaching dark ambience at times yet refusing to be pigeonholed into a specific genre

As to the BDSM it neither was in any way certainly not for a like myself and I do play hard nor did it come over as healthy despite the regular protestations of Moira that she was doing this as per her free will Nor did Simon come over as resting healthily in himself I wont go into large details anyone with a serious inkling of behaviour which ought to be avoided at all costs within BDSM play will know what I mean when I point out that theres a load of codependent and abusive behaviour in the story as experienced by the characters It would be acceptable if the author noticed and acknowledged that but she doesnt She also mixes in her apparently private kink of Daddygirl infantilism play without giving it enough room in the novel to stand on a leg Instead these influxes come over as just skeevy and weird not in a funny way
So there we have it my take on it all The question is can a happy medium be found between the two ideologies in the modern brewing industry I would like to think so and from what Ive seen not many British brewers strictly back one side or the other Most upstart brewers from the s and s started out with a range of traditional products but are now branching out to new ideas

Apparently the ticket office and waiting room that would be built in Portobello would be an eyesore This coming from the council that approved millions of pounds worth of permaroadworks known to you and me as the trams project Now Im bias towards transport projects so Im going to focus on the pros side of the argument However from the research I did at the time the con argument mainly seems to be the same tired eyesore and people not liking the monopoly Stagecoach has on buses
Finally we might at least suspect that Charles and William got more than just a little help in order to get a degree at all and it might be worth mentioning that Bo Guagaus first language is Chinese Interestingly his tutors at Oxford expressed contempt for him something we can be sure of the Windsors tutors didnt do with their charges but it might just be that somebody who sat finals without taking their classes and gets a i just them off

BG There are a couple of obvious things I suppose Most of the stories in Walking the Labyrinth were set in the south Wales valleys and many of them explored issues around Welsh identity and culture Only a few of the stories in Blindfold have valleys settings though some of them are set in Cardiff and theres less of an attempt to explore those issues specific to postindustrial south Wales for want of a better phrase Many of the stories in this new collection are set elsewhere or often have nonspecific sometimes vaguely surreal settings Im really not sure why that should be the case to be honest Perhaps I felt Id worked through some of those specific cultural issues in the previous collection though it certainly wasnt a conscious decision

The final paper of the consultation was Jeff Hubing on the Purpose of Acts A Literary Study Hubing argued that the prologue of Acts ought to include not simply the first three verses The programmatic statement in is a the center of this pericope and the whole unit is a resumptive prologue reminding the reader of what the author as already said in Luke and what he will be saying in the rest of the book This is something like how did we get here and where are we going To a certain extent this is like the programmatic statement in Luke Jesus reading Isaiah in the synagogue at Nazareth Hubing did an excellent job showing that the key vocabulary in Acts spirit power witness is scattered throughout the book but especially at key points

Once I had heard from Laura that we could wrap everything up I thanked everyone for allowing us access to their home and I then set off towards Birmingham One thing I wont forget heading back was the amount of fog when passing through Oxfordshire Before I forget to mention I need to dedicate part of this post to Laura who was great in making sure I was alright during my time out on location leaving Surrey and getting back to my hotel safely I made it back am and wasnt even tired from driving there and back When I am next in the studio touch wood I will ask Jonathan how he got on on his location if and when I am asked to go back to Maverick So I am happy in the knowledge that I can drive to locations by myself and I hope I get to do more of this cool stuff Although I had a few wobbly moments getting there I felt better after getting tonnes of support from Maverick and the person I headed down to see

About me uh I cannot spell I am mother of three wife to one and an only child booo for me I am a selfproclaimed geek I HATE to clean and I like to make messes and start lots of projects that sometimes I never find the time to finish but you probably want to know about why I am relevant to giving you advice in the photography realm Because it makes me sound fancy I will start with I have a degree in photography Yes there is an actual degree in an accredited college for photography but after reading the twelve weeks to better photos lessons I kinda feel like I got ripped off The lessons are really awesome I wish I would have known about them back in my Elementary Photography Days So I started taking pictures in H and I am going to leave it at that because I would rather talk more about the subject than me because I am not that cool and light is or it can be hot but anyway

Our book is an expansion of this dissertation both in terms of the breadth of the corpus of quotations in vol and in terms of the philological and linguistic discussions in vol TiroshBecker discusses such questions as the ways in which Karaite scholars treated rabbinic material whether or not they forged it for their own purposes usually not but there is one fake barayta forged by Sahel b Masliah mentioned on p and what they called it when they quoted it usually the first ones said ql lwaln She also devotes an extensive chapter to the question of the script employed in Karaite works Karaite writers used both Hebrew and Arabic scripts and wrote both languages in both scripts This is of importance to the linguist as many rabbinic sources are transliterated into Arabic script allowing for the reconstruction of the reading tradition of certain words eg the reading ribbi is attested as in all other rabbinic sources and not rabbi the letter is transliterated as jim and as ghain depending on its positon in the word gevul but reghilim

Predictably all ended up fine I got to my destination the university to meet some friends was chaperoned out of the bus and only let go after it became clear that I had indeed regained consciousness and knew where I needed to go Now several hours later I sit at an Arab cafe next to the uni with a milk coffee and a pastry feeling quite jolly But something about this experience struck me Although I had witnessed quite a few wacky things on public transport around the globe before today including an exhibitionist in France a tearful breakup in the US and sadistic German bus drivers who close the bus door just in front of your nose after you ran half a mile to make the last bus but never had I seen what the Transmilenio offered me this morning an intense loss and subsequent return of human empathy within an hour or so And I am glad to say that I can count on my fellow Bogotanians Well at least the J crowd

An earlier comment suggested the possibility that if a god turned up ie appeared in some form that we humans could recognize then it would be possible to determine using the scientific method to prove that he existed But it wouldnt Because there are no forms under which a god could appear that we could be scientifically certain was divine Think about it how would God have to appear to convince scientists that it was a god and not a natural form

Im curious to hear your thoughts on this To me WEM is just a targeted marketingtechnology offshoot of a larger sociological phenomenon Understanding why these new WEM concepts are important helps to make you ask the right kinds of questions Companies arent dumping millions of dollars into these technologies on a whim As it continues I believe well work through an accelerated Darwinist phase where certain companies learn fast what works and what doesnt That really translates to truly understanding consumers Companies who dont get it will perish If you ask me its going to be a of a ride

Death is all about us in every form manifesting the wages of sin That should be simply believable The only way for man to save himself from eternal damnation is to die for his sin The wages of sin is death Romans But then no one would ever be saved unless God stepped in and that He did He sent His only begotten Son into the world taking upon Himself our sinful flesh and died in our behalf God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us Romans

Everyone who received a book was very appreciative and grateful Im afraid that we were not as successful as wed hoped at reaching reluctant or light readers A couple of selfadmitted reluctant readers studied our selection and ended up leaving empty handed saying that they already had enough books to read Im wondering if that was partly because all of our books were serious fiction and perhaps too literary for light readers Now that I look at some of the other possibilities I realize that our selections probably reflect our highfalutin fiction preferencesperhaps not as appealing to those light readers We chose books that wed read and loved If wed been distributing The Hunger Games perhaps even light readers would have been interested The Hunger Games was one of the choices but of course it was the most popular

I know from the comics that the situation never improves theres never any cure and its only in recent months almost issues into the run that the series has even begun to hint at the possibility of moving past constant survival situations and towards rebuilding some semblance of civilization Ive never been a fan of the comic before Kirkmans weaknesses as a writer such as the flatness of his characters and the methodicalasabricklayer pacing and unimaginative plotting are hard to ignore but I have to admit Ive been reading with some small interest these last few months as the series has begun to inch towards the establishment of a new society Why Because this is something different this is something weve never really seen before in survival horror rebuilding from the ground up after almost everything else has been destroyed I dont know where this story will go but the political theorist in me wants to see if the series will commit to this new direction or if its just a feint before the inevitable and boring return to the road

Using the right hair products however is the most essential Like I mentioned above wrong hair products can cause irritation on scalp skin and cause dandruff Hair care products I think is my favorite remedy A few weeks ago I shared an article on Clear shampoo I keep going back to their facebook page httpwwwfacebookcomclear and I have attached a recent picture I found on it calling the scalp flaky land was funny but that is exactly what I feel every winter season my head is flaky land for sure I shampoo every alternate day it helps keep the moisture in my hair and at the same time keeps my scalp clean and dandruff free

When asked why he chose to call his detective Hieronymus Bosch Connelly said I wanted all aspects of his character to be meaningful if possible This of course would include his name I briefly studied the work of the real Hieronymus Bosch while in college He was a th century painter who created richly detailed landscapes of debauchery and violence and human defilement There is a world gone mad feel to many of his works including one called Hell of which a print hangs on the wall over the computer where I write I thought this would be the perfect name for my character because I saw the metaphoric possibilities of juxtaposing contemporary Los Angeles with some of the Bosch paintings Janet Maslin writes Like James Ellroy and John Fante both of whose work is referred to here Mr Connelly continues to make his doomy secretive Los Angeles a living breathing character in his stories If the world of the novel is filled with violence and brutality it is redeemed by some of the characters who refuse to beaten by it

Open minds open innovation Not so many years ago the term open innovation was unknown to the intellectual property community While the concept existed there was little evidence that it existed or that it was likely to gain any currency at all before the publication in of Henry Chesburghs Open Innovation The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology Since then the term has gained momentum in common parlance However it is only in the past year or two that open innovation is becoming something that is more widely and positively spoken of as something which a business might participate in rather than as something rather strange and risky to be indulged in by others preferably in North America and the AsiaPacific

Romance novels about erectile dysfunction and STDs werent exactly big sellers Jillian Grayson wrote under the pen name of Jaclyn West Shed written fourteen bestsellers so far and had more money than she needed flowing in so her next novel could wait The book royalties had paid for her large beautiful house in Miami She still had plenty of money even after the divorce which forced her to part with nearly half of her earnings to her exhusband Shell never forget the day she came home early from a book tour and found George performing oral on that in the poolthe pool she had paid for and an act he would rarely if ever do for her Jillian always thought he hated oral or more specifically he hated the giving part But there he was standing in the shallow end of the pool and going to work on some other woman as she floated in the pool on a ring which Jillian had also paid for The pool oral thing actually looked like it might be kind of fun and Jillian often
On Tuesday I decided that some speed intervals were required and so had Jeff Galloway He drawled that today we will be doing some race pace intervals and as the weather wasnt good I opted for the treadmill I had put Jeff and his Easy k away but now that the evenings are stretching out I have more time for longer runs and so out hes come again Its nice having that structure One of the other reasons why Id stopped using the app was because it was pushing me too hard and I was becoming despondent Scratch that I was pushing myself too hard as usual Id got my heart set on subbing minutes for my k from a minute PB Rather than aim for minutes I was aiming for attempting to knock minutes off my time and I was near killing myself in the process I am now wearing my sensible hat have readjusted the app and its now set for minute miles With any luck one mile will be minutes long The difference as I told my husband afterwards as we soaked in the hot tub who needs ice baths was that I could easily manage the race pace sprints in the middle of the run instead of struggling to finish them and sometimes even stopping to walk during them

First of all let me draw your attention to my third book Lias Guide to Winning the Lottery True it is not obviously a boy book true it has both a handbag and a shoe on the cover But I think that most people who liked WIWJ and AT would enjoy it It is not just about money and shopping although those are elements it also should make you think about about economics and values but in a good way families friendship and Facebook There is some suspense and a twisty plot The heroine gets nicer Trust me

Doesnt it feel awful when you finish a puzzle and find that there are missing pieces I used to think so I took a photo of this puzzle because I was going to send it to the manufacturer to see if I could get replacement pieces Incidently this puzzle is called the worlds smallest puzzle I think it was only like by when completed I was cleaning not too long ago to have friends over for dinner and I moved the table Under the leg of the table were two puzzle pieces each not too much bigger than square So I never saw the puzzle completed but I added the pieces to the can so that the next gullible person who completes the puzzle will get a full view

Healthy Eating
For a movie with such tight plotting its surprisingly energetic with plenty of action to accompany the plot twists Seeing Dae Su take on ridiculous amounts of people is always entertaining and Minsik Choi does a wonderful job showing the complexities of this character who is past the edge of lunacy and yet remarkably self aware in a way that only fifteen years of isolation could produce The fighting is not graceful but unconventional This is a man who could likely avoid a hit but doesnt always want to bother stepping out of the way Plowing through is his main tactic and he does quite well with it most of the time Its also of interest that for such a story Dae Su doesnt kill people happy to stop when he has what he wants or they stop attacking His first fight is almost entirely based on curiosity can his imaginary practice work We get the sense that being hit is nothing to him and almost welcomed as a reminder that he isnt imprisoned anymore Hes full of rage but not arbitrary malice Hes into hitting but not creating suffering except for a few exceptions

Instead of developing the ostensible main character the book focuses on the three sisters and Edie becomes just a set of eyes an outsider standin for the reader who does a lot of telling instead of showing Morton wants to deliver a mystery to make us wonder about how these three women came to spend their entire lives in a decaying castle But the mystery of it all is laid on so thick that we learn next to nothing about the characters until the final act By then I cared little for Saffy and Percy Blythe or the origins of the mysterious Mud Man These people even edit their own thoughts to keep us from discovering their secrets which by the way are not even that scandalous or surprising The only one with any semblance of depth was Juniper Blythe who had some vivacity in her early appearances in the novel as a young girl but is rendered into a Jane Eyre Berthaesque specter in Edies presentday interactions with her As Morton keeps us from the secrets whole chapters end up feeling like treading water I kept telling myself thered be some kind of shocking payoff but there wasnt t can hardly believe the same person wrote both these books

Still its not necessary to go to this extreme to get caught up in contemplation of what you dont want to imitate There are doubtless plenty of reasons why so many people in the climate change movement never got around to accepting the sharp reductions in their personal carbon footprints that they wanted to impose on everyone else but Ive long suspected that too much contemplation of what they thought they were fighting was one of them There were some people in that movement who tried to sketch out visions of a lowcarbon future that was more interesting and more appealing than the present but by and large the movement presented the world with a choice between a continuation of business as usual by lowcarbon means on the one hand and planetary dieoff on the other The ineffective but familiar strategy of trying to get people to change by scaring the bejesus out of themsinners in the hands of an angry Gaiatook over from there preaching vehemently about greedy polluters ravaging the Earth in an of conspicuous consumption The result was to make this image so powerful that a great many people in the climate change movement were drawn into contemplating it and thus imitating it

Next up Allendale Pale Ale is a very pale golden take on a new world American pale ale This beer speaks with plenty of hugely perfumed mango papaya tropical fruit and citric notes in the aroma im guessing a dry hopping of citra hops The palate then gives more papaya mango and tropical fruit over a light malt body and some very sappy yet subtle hop resins linger in the finish A very pale ale indeed this isnt your typical Allendale beer but closer to something you would expect from the likes of Roosters or Magic Rock Slick and clean on the fermentation and malt flavours with lots of resonating leafy citric hops This would be great for the summer so its a shame its a freezing cold febuary night

According to a new study from the Economic Policy Institute the wages of entrylevel workers sucked big time during the Lost decade beginning when Bush too office That isnt a coincidence Lets blame the Republicans and Bush but we cant forget that Slick Willie played a huge roll in this think Nafta and that great sucking sound down South On the other hand maybe Slick Willie doesnt deserve to be completely joined with Bush at the hip of responsibility since young workers experienced wage growth during his last five years in office

When we do begin to give praise because its not about no praise we dont link the work with the the child We might think that telling a child that they are a good drawer an intrinsic value of themselves is a lovely and supportive thing to say What happens when they do an incorrect drawing What happens when their drawing is criticised at school at college Or when they dont win any prize Saying thats a great drawing is subtle but different Possibly more supportive you really tried hard with that one or you really enjoyed that

This has been compounded by the refusal of ordinary people to realize know and understand that it is the duplicity of Governments and the deceit and endless greed of bankers that combined to simply fleece them like the apathetic sheep they are Apathy and ignorance of the truth creates belief in the lie The truth is selfevident but most people choose to neither hear it nor understand it The debts of the Federal Reserve are the debts of a private corporation that is robbing the people of the United States

Although Moscow handed me plenty of victories defeats and draws those two weeks the trip began inauspiciously On day two my husband Hal and I took the metro to Izmailovsky Park a massive fleamarket in the citys outskirts I hesitantly threaded my way through the stalls of subpar bags and sneakers pausing out of timid politeness to try on a jacket a hawker pressed towards me Suddenly a throng of swarthy overeager leather salesmen assailed me pulling and grasping at my arms barking at me to try their wares Perfectly innocent though it was the scene awakened some dark reasonless old terror in me My husband Hal saw my panic knew why it might tend to arise disproportionately to the situation and extracted me I retreated to the hotel feeling thoroughly overwhelmed

Usually we have our test in October and we meet up with dozens of homeschooling families from all over the county and the kids have a fun time visiting and accomplish a state requirement at the same time But last October Isabelle had two teeth pulled the day before the test Truly she was quite the trooper and handled the procedure and the aftermath with a grace and patience which belied her age But there was no way I was asking the girl to sacrifice two teeth and then take a test That would just be evil
The film really only focuses on two villains here Vivica A Fox and Lucy Liu and they are both very good at playing these evil roles especially Liu who I think had her best performance ever in this flick She plays ORen Ishii and is one of those samurai sword waving villains that you always see in the kungfu movies and seem cheesy as but never do you take them as seriously as you take this chick Liu plays this character very well because shes very quiet a lot of the times and more or less lets her killing do the speaking for her Its a shame that Liu hasnt really gotten the right roles after this but I guess thats what usually happens to you when your biggest blockbuster hit was Charlies Angels

Elsewhere Fr Olivieri also points to the matter of devastating motion which Bob has wrongly confused with the elliptical orbits And Fr Olivieri also points out scientific discoverieseg stellar aberration and nutationthat cannot be explained by geocentrists without resorting to special pleading Therefore Bobs contention that Fr Olivieri makes elliptical orbits the crux of the matter is unsupported and false Elliptical orbits was one of many things to which Fr Olivieri pointed to demonstrate that the views of modern astronomers were not the same as those of Copernicus and hence not the same as what was addressed in the decree Based on a false and sloppy analysis Bob has repeatedly and unjustly accused this Catholic priest of lying and subterfuge Such it seems is the typical approach of the neogeocentrist

EMI were supposed to have issued the album One Million Smiles themselves in but following the total underperformance of the singles issued from it they immediately appeared to get cold feet For two years after that it apparently remained locked in the vaults where it may have remained for good had Org not stepped in to rescue the project By the time they issued the album however whatever interest anyone had in Inaura had totally disappeared and it was left to bellyflop on to record store shelves in two whole years after the last single from it had emerged The subsequent public disinterest surely surprised nobody If EMIs marketing muscle hadnt persuaded the world about Inauras worth then what was a tiny indie going to achieve years after the band had even last been in the mainstream music press

The word deliberate in the above definition is the only word that throws a spanner in the works All the other terms tally percent with what is happening in South Africa at this very moment The word deliberate however has bearing on the conscious intent of the perpetrators It thus creates a loophole which the criminals and the government can rely on to effectively shift the spotlight away from genocide and to thus blame the killings on other factors such as crime poverty etc How many times has Malema for example said that chanting the words Kill the Boer has caused no harm How many times have we heard the savage killers the few that get arrested say in court we never acted deliberately

But dominant selfcontrol isnt only useful in conflict situations its also usefully applicable to situations where a woman is attempting to get a rise out of you either through sexual provocation or a test Do exactly the same thing Dont react breathe blink ask for her to repeat herself Youll find that you can make a woman who is striking a provocative pose to blush and stammer simply by not reacting and calmly asking her to repeat herself once or twice Of course because youve gone from played to player and because women are naturally attracted to both social and sexual dominance this will tend to create attraction even where none initially existed

Many Church Fathers thought they found here a testimony about the two natures of Christ human and divine But against this v does not focus on Jesus human nature per se but rather on his human lineage through David and v is not about what Christ is according to his divine nature but rather about what happened to Jesus at the resurrection when Gods Spirit raised him from the dead and designated or marked him out as Son of God in power In other words these are comments about two phases in the trajectory of Jesus careerThe unusual phrase Spirit of Holiness is surely not a reference to Jesus human spirit Rather it refers to the effect of the Holy Spirit on Jesus Jesus enters an entirely sanctified or glorified condition when he is raised from the dead by the Spirit

Then I heard startling news that Newport Beachs library was going all digital They would retain their childrens library and activities in addition to a few other services Throughout the day I thought about the ramifications I considered the implications if all information everywhere was available only digitally and required a power source for the access devices What if all power systems ceased to function Those individuals retaining memory bank knowledge they could share would be prized elders in every community We would have come full circle with our early ancestors but would just be on a different level from them Tonights news reported the story was incorrect with the true facts misunderstood Meanwhile an interview with the librarys representative discussing an alarmed Australian communique on the change revealed her amazement the library had been receiving these inquiries from all over the world

When you are always serving your cup will always be empty When you do not accept the service of others you will have nothing to give to others its inevitable that you will crash and burn On the other hand when you are willing to let others serve you and you do not serve others yourself your cup will be overflowing and the excess will go to waste It does not take much effort to serve others generally There are times when its truly a sacrifice to serve others
The problem is this If the second chamber does exercise its scrutiny role properly even more if it is motivated by partisan opposition to the government it will sometimes reject important government bills What then If the bill is a matter of confidence as are all money bills and possibly some others its defeat by convention triggers the governments resignation or dissolution of Parliament usually the latter But is it a good idea to hand to a second chamber with a will of its own as Waldron wants it the power to threaten and eventually to force dissolution at any disagreement If this power can be exercised for partisan purposes as it seems bound to be this is a recipe for disaster with elections coming as often as the secondchamber majority thinks it can install its allies in power On the other hand so long as the government thinks it has more to gain from an election than the secondchamber majority it will be able to ride roughshod over the second chambers scrutiny by making any bill a matter of confidence and thus threatening dissolution if it is rejected
Its an absurd excuse to say that after a task has been given and clarified it is a basic expectation for the subordinate to deliver the goods on his own and take it upon himself to ask questions and clarify details when needed Its like saying its not any supervisors responsibility to follow up on the progress of the tasks to check up on the person to see if hes doing well and to give feedback to correct or improve performance Whats worse is when supervisors say they dont have the time or they appear that they dont have time which is on purpose

The second mode is the Southern plantation model which spread due west from the tidewater country until it ran up against certain hard political realities well discuss next week The plantation model started out as a straightforward export economy but found itself drawn into the orbit of the rising industrial system cotton from Southern plantations was eagerly sought by the textile mills of the English Midlands and the political economy of the cotton belt morphed into a pattern that ought to be profoundly familiar to Americans today though its generally not its the pattern found today in Third World nations under American or European in which raw materials for industry overseas are produced under harsh conditions by a vast and impoverished labor force while a small upper class is well rewarded for keeping the system running smoothly Thats the Southern model and it drives a very different mode of imperial expansion in which arable land and cheap labor are the central targets of empire

And God bless Tennessee truly I do love that place and there is aways a moment where we cross the border and I know Im home again Oh sure the landscape is the familiar rocky hills I grew up with and the accent is sweet and twangy but what really makes it feel like home are the billboards Since we come in from Virginia to the east we pass close to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge and if you know anything about those places youll know that they are the craziest tourist trap towns in the entire southern US and much of the um attractions are devoted to how shall I say the indigenous culture of the east Tennessee hills Hillbillies in other words Even when I was growing up and we would vacation there every year back before Dolly opened her Wood and before the place really took off there was a miniature golf course called Hillbilly Golf its still there but apparently theyre too hillbilly for a website Now they have those big dinner arena things like Medieval Times but with feuding lumberjacks Every other billboard for miles was for Lumberjack Feud And then there was one for moonshine Somebody got the bright idea to legally distill and sell corn liquor IN MASON JARS And Im cursing like awell like meas we pass these magnificent roadside advertisements because I cant just whip out my camera and get a picture of them for you I love it that I get hate mail when I make fun of my redneck brethren and yet Tennesseeans are exploiting it themselves left and right

I have to thank Shawn at Crafty Chics Blog for her detailed instructions on putting together a diaper cake She did a blog tutorial in July which she posted in sections over a few days If you are interested in viewing her tutorial be sure to start with Part One Diaper Cake Getting Started I will throw one additional little tip in to go along with Shawns instructions I was at home and ready to get started and I didnt have any ribbon or large enough rubberbands that would work to secure the diapers together in the larger layers Since the rubberbands were not large enough to go around the entire bundle I just started grouping diapers at a time around the core base that I already had placed a rubberband around by adding a new rubberband and securing it to the base by stretching the rubberband around at least one of the diapers in the exisiting core I continued this same pattern of piecing together another or at a time and securing with a new rubberband I was using the small Goody rubberbands out of the hair care aisle I decided to use those on the diapers because I didnt have to wrap them more than once I could just roll the diaper and slide the rubberband over it Does that make sense to everyone the way I wrote it I hope soI should have taken a picture of that step to add Once I got the enter layer complete THEN I added the decorative ribbon around the outside but it wasnt for structurejust as a finishing touch

Having come fresh from the coalface heres how written historical sources work since the midtwentieth century and the age of mass communication you can find lots of references to pretty much anything if you know where to look The biggest problem facing future historians looking at the early st century will be too much material relating to any subject not too little

Good morning all I am sure you have all been wondering just exactly why I have been so silent Certainly it is very uncharacteristic to say the least But the truth of the matter is there has been a rather large monkey wrench those monkeys anyway thrown into the cogs on the wheel of life around here So bear with me while I figure out how to go about this

The fact that we managed to beat England inside days by wickets is beyond amazing for many reasons The problems of Pakistan cricket with the spotfixing scandal are well documented Added to the mix was a crazy captain who retired from cricket only to return months later a mad Chairman of the Board who finally got replaced a coach who quit because of the mad captain and jail sentences for the Pakistani cricketer involved in the spotfixing crisis What you end up with then is the normal stew of Pakistan cricket power politics inconsistency and wacky decisionmaking It has to be said though that this team has been different MisbahulHaq may just manage to pull of the most incredible feat in the history of Pakistan cricket being forgiven for losing a match against India in the World Cup Under his leadership there is a calm and stability amongst the team that I certainly have never seen and I doubt few have Even in the days of Imran Khan there was an element of drama Yet at years young Misbah has managed to do what so few Pakistani captains have done before him get his boys to play as a team

The Last Ringbearer is a curious piece of work At least in this translation its an often prosaic adventure story reminiscent of the most ordinary work of Isaac Asimov who was capable of rendering interesting ideas in pedestrian ways As a reenvisioning of one of the persistent motifs of Tolkiens trilogy the clash between spirit and flesh between the soul and the brain Yeskovs novel is rather onedimensional

Thus the occupation and use of Tahrir Square as a stage for protest can be seen as important for a number of reasons Firstly logistically because Tahrir Square offers an open public space that is surrounded by a mix of political cultural international and academic buildings it logistically provides an ideal stage for revolution a place where the protestors can gather and be seen and heard by relevant audiences Secondly the symbolic act of reclaiming a space with a long history of civic struggle and physically taking it back for the people by mass occupation is a powerful gesture With the landscape surrounding Tahrir as the background to their revolution protestors dare to imagine a future Egypt of their own and a city that belongs to them

Kate Hudson and I were paired up with Katie McKenna and began understanding what the project was about and what Katie wanted to accomplish The nice thing about this experience was the Brett and Ben had all of the teams create a concise idea before coming to Hot Hacks so we had a good idea to begin with and rolled with it What Katie envisioned was a way to showcase the different perspectives of various speakers regarding our environment To do this we wanted to use a parallax effect and separate the project into different sections that the user could scroll through and experience each perspective independently with its own unique theme Another issue that we had to address early on was the fact that Popcorn has a tendency to throw a lot of information at you very abruptly To combat this we used various transitions and effects to blur content that wasnt the primary focus at the moment and ease it in when it was relevant In doing so we created an experience that allows the user to focus on what the speaker is saying but also annotate important information when it made sense Another unique aspect of our project was the fact that we utilized scrolling to drive the Popcorn experience throughout the demo This meant that the user could freely explore the page with the opportunity to jump between perspectives seamlessly This meant that the user could navigate as they saw fit and not feel like we were spoon feeding them a linear experience

There were about forty people dancing on the tile landing crazily gesturing with their hands We settled in for the long haul because this was better than anything we would be watching on tv We had been taking turns looking through the peephole for about an hour when someone turned the music off and our thumping hearts finally subsided There in the middle of the landing was the couple who rented the apartment across the way They were about a foot apart from one another and their hands were flying wildly about but still barely a sound came out of their mouths The people around them were as mesmerized as we were watching them signing to one another furiously Finally the woman gave a strangled sounding cry pounded her fist into her palm and slapped her partner My brother and I were in hysterics

The outlook of MACHINE GIRL and ROBOGEISHA director Iguchi on the other hand hints at an upstart Peter Jackson the type of genius filmmaker who can coat the screen with screaming skinned bodies and still have you rolling with hysterical laughter as he works his demented magic Toss in a prolific background and a very public infatuation with things entering or exiting butts and it would be a fair assumption that Iguchi is without a doubt a truly oneofakind action filmmaker

This week there was some discussion of the Writer Vs Planner approach to writing Some people are writers in that they just sit down and spill out their thoughts without any structural notes or plans and let the story and characters form organically Others are planners those who methodically make notes and lists and charts about plot and characters and locations etc so that its all laid out before them before they commit pen to paper for chapter one The group seemed to have a slightly higher proportion of planners from what I could tell

Conch Villaheights was on the outermost edge of the Conch and nowhere near the scenic region It was a dated rundown building on the verge of urban decay As she neared the building Tina checked her wrist meter and noticed a dip in positive energy production If there was a noticeable decline over a block away she wondered how bad it would be at the actually investigation site The Villaheight was a restored relic Some of its columns and window trim were actual Indiana limestone quarried from nearby Bloomington but most of the stone work was now synthetic and looked better than the original which were pitted and stained beyond repair Tina walked up the graded entrance to the foyer doors and tapped a key on the klantien cover beneath the buildings grid number The cover opened on invisible hinges and Tina leaned in checking the codes She waved her wrist over the instrument and checked the readings next to her personal meter Not good This building had not only fallen below negative output it was now sucking life from the surrounding blocks

You see before we bought our first house I thought nothing at all of going up to a wall armed with a hammer and nails and just sticking things where ever But a funny thing happens when you arent renting anymore Suddenly you feel a sense of responsibility over putting nails in perfectly good brand spanking new walls Its silly really But this whole paralytic approach to decorating and getting things wrong has kept mewellparalyzed We dove right in and furnished the rooms where we spend the most time kitchen family room bedroom but never would I say we decorated them
Ive heard this verse many times One of those verses that turns into a clich in your head and loses its true meaning in your life Until I needed it God has been speaking to me through scripture about this truth over and over again in different contexts Whenever I am tempted to believe that happiness would come from having more things more money or even more money to GIVE God reminds me that there is actually no difference at all between those who have more and those who have less No matter how much you have or dont have its Godliness combined with contentment that makes you wealthy

The plane landed in Manila after hours and as I walk out to the airport I saw a throng of press people waiting at the lobby I saw TV Patrols new showbiz reporter CAMILLE RAMOS and she and her crew seemed to be waiting for someone I stopped to wave but she didnt see me because someone finally arrived With guards and assistants around her Ms International RUSSEL NHERIE BERNABE went back to the Philippines after coaching and attending Ms International She also visited the OFWs in Hawaii while she was there extending her ear to all our needy fellowmen as the Philippines Ambassador of Goodwill And since they seem to be all so busy I decided to leave peacefully thinking I should interview her too for a women empowerment article
Unfortunately however one of the parallels with our past is that failed policies are sometimes intensified rather than abandoned This happened with the pass laws for example before PW Botha finally repealed them in It may also happen now with the Employment Equity Act with its provisions for heavier fines to enforce racial quotas upon all employers when the Government cannot even get Denel or Eskom or SAA or Transnet to meet its racial targets at management or skilled levels

To wait until a record is actually set then say we realize we dont meet the standards but the mark is so good can you allow it anyway is just inexcusable and just another example of how unprofessional this sport can be at times And for the organizers to essentially say that the course has not yielded such fast times before therefore it does not aid the runners is a ludicrous argument For example the Johannesburg track never yielded a sub before Linford Christie ran in and then Obadele Thompson blazed in Yet the altitude was always there Point being that conditions do not always yield exceptional results even though they exist Exceptional results are a result of exceptional conditions being taken advantage of by exceptional athletes in the course of exceptional competition One of the reasons why records are simply not an every day occurrence

American President Bush in his first brief statement on the multiple attacks on the United States in the president according to BBC said Conduct a fullscale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act Terrorism against our nation will not stand And later in a full speech I culled this These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat but they have failed I watched President Bush live and I saw the strong convictions in his words and demonstrations It is such that sends a threatening signal to whoever masterminded the attacks I cant really recollect any major terror attack on US soil after these words were sentI stand to be corrected please

So it sounds like it would be a great place to move to right Like if you needed a job and didnt mind the heat and the ultraconservative climate this would be the place to come right Before you pack up the kids and the dog though therere just a few things to consider First is the total lack of housing When youve got this kind of economic boom and this many people have flooded in construction cant keep pace There are hardly any houses to rentif any at alland not very many to buy Apartments are full most or allI dont know for sure with waiting lists And whats really telling so are the motels and hotels Oil companies rent rooms for weeks and months at a time for the executives who come in to check up on business and workers are living in the roomsas many men packed into a room as can fit You hear of five and six men living in one motel room The parking lots are full of work trucks in the evenings late RV parks are full and although I havent seen them Ive been told there are tent cities outside of town There were in the s in the last huge boomthere were tents in vacant lots then The parking lot of The Dreaded WalMart is full most nights and while most of those RVs are probably people passing through I suspect some of them are people living there setting up their BBQ grill next to the shopping cart corral

MW Thats because there was no benefit and I know that theres nothing in the report that shows it One United Bank did not get any immediate help from the Treasury The Bank then went to the private market and got million in loans to help them stabilize their lending The banks investors did not lose anything The way I see it the committee took bits from conversation and information between staff members about the economic crisis and the Treasurys role in it and then pieced them together to try to make something out of it And its not fair

Goddard says the band originally attempted this in July several months prior to the main Meat Is Murder sessions The very first July take stretched to nearly minutes long was much more roughready and much more skifflerockabilly than the final MIM track Mozs vocal is really rough around the edges it doesnt sound like hes fully worked out the melody or his phrasing and the lyric itself isnt as tight as it would become Based on this it can only be assumed the version here is the very same first take mentioned by Goddard I absolutely adore Marrs unique electric guitar playing on this version its got a nice crunch that adds a lot to this track that is missing on all other attempts
We need the discernment of the Holy Spirit to distinguish the difference between condemnation and conviction Condemnation is the work of the devil and is a downward spiral of hopelessness and despair that leads to destruction and death Conviction is the work of the Holy Spirit who reveals the sin that has separated us from Him but instead of tearing us down He gives us hope healing and freedom through His love forgiveness grace and mercy and it brings about repentance that leads to life Cor

No one involved with these projects as far as I know seems to directly account for McLuhan as some godfather of the interdisciplinary field but I would argue that none of these scholarly endeavors would have been possible without him Contemporary scholars working toward more critical dimensions in the relations between religious media and mediated religion rarely quote from McLuhan and thats probably as it should beMcLuhan was happy to utter grand sentences and had a knack for aphorisms that may or may not be proven correct But the proclamations of the Toronto literature professor especially in the s opened doors to ways of thinking far beyond the content analysis that can still occupy religious thinking on the media McLuhans mostfamous dictum The medium is the message was expanded on in his Understanding Media The Extensions of Man The statement is certainly hyperbole but building on others work at the time including Lewis Mumford Eric Havelock and Harold Innis McLuhan used the very media he examined to shock us into the reality that how a message is conveyed really does matter

I actually rather like the idea if that indeed is a trend going forward I mean it would have been great to have had Atlantas Olympic stadiumtrack preserved and the facility used to host say the World Championships no offense to Seville It would have given the US its first hosting of the global track championships AND it would have provided us with a much needed track and field facility to use for other events such as Olympic Trials NCAA Championships another bid for a World Championships and perhaps another Diamond League or Euro Circuit meet All of which would have come free of charge via the Olympic construction of the site Instead here we sit with nothing left from the construction of Atlanta save our memories of the event and Centennial Olympic Park nice but not much of an athletics legacy from the worlds greatest athletic event

Now during the month of March which was nearly months ago I had several workout challenges going on in Marchabs jumping jacks and Jillian Michaelsall of which were to assist me in my neverending weightloss battle Each challenge grew progressively harder as the month continued partially due to the fact that I was doing all three at the same time Maybe that wasnt the brightest idea but everything is in hindsight

Anyhow these last few weeks have been tough I have come to the realisation that not only does my boss not like me but that the school has no intention of promoting me in the near future as they had heavily hinted at probably to stop me from moving on Well theyve shot themselves in the foot there as Im applying for other jobs The aforementioned school have managed to wear down my confidence so much that I was just looking at regular teaching jobs at first until the Head of English at a local school asked me why on earth I was underselling myself and nudged me towards applying for Second in Command Now thats a title I like
Make no mistake about it these guys want to start for one reason and one reason only money Maybe they are just personally selfish guys or maybe its an overall attitude that younger pitchers are taking around the league as a whole Ive noticed a few of the young Tampa Bay pitchers act like spoiled children on the mound at times Apparently the million over years that Papelbon earned on the free agent market wasnt enough Whatever the reason the Red Sox desperately need to find someone to close out games and the fact that neither of these guys seem to want to step up is incredibly disappointing

This variety of insistence on only one right way of doing things and that one practice or one tradition or one pantheon should be sufficient and whole unto itself to minister to any individuals every spiritual need to the exclusion of and even demeaning of all else outside of that tradition is something that has an entirely creedal monotheistic origin and has no real place within a polytheist framework where pluralism is the rule and the repeatedly demonstrable preference at every point The notion that polytheist religions are religions of orthopraxy rather than orthodoxy is often as illconceived as the notion that orthodoxy and questions of belief really matter within polytheism at all The ontheground realities in most places in the premodern polytheistic worlds were polypraxy no matter what deities or practices may have been shared outside of local contexts everyone had their own way of doing things and each community developed their own calendar their own demeanor and any number of other diversifying and differentiating characteristics And this was all good and no one seemed to get too upset about it So the notion that one orthopraxy must be enforced or is a viable ideal within polytheismeven of a reconstructionist varietyis one that I dont personally think is very useful

Retaining Patent Examiners There may well be benefits to reducing examiner attrition But the evidence suggests that weeding out bad patents is not among them Empirical research by Lemley and Sampat shows that the longer examiners spend at the PTO the less searching they do the less likely they are to issue initial rejections or demand claim amendments and the more likely they are to ultimately grant a patent Lemley Sampat It is the most junior examiners who are most likely to reject applications The reason is not precisely clear but may have to do with increased workloads on senior examiners or with acculturation into a corps whose ethos is to grant rather than deny patents

For those of us who post regularly as in or times a week a blog challenge is not too terribly demanding We may have to stretch a bit to post a few more days or doubleup on some days but overall the push isnt that great Many many bloggers however post much less frequently so a day challenge can be a huge demand on their time energy and creativity

I am getting off subject already and I havent even introduced the subject of this blog His name is Andrew Andrew is a true blue Northern Minnesotan He is from Scandinavian decent and white as can be Andrew belongs to a privileged group of people He is a white American male with good work ethic from a small town and a small school who has been well educated Now we could spend a long time delving in to his life and talking about the privileges and benefits or difficulties or get in to a debate about whether or not you think he is actually privileged just because of the aforementioned characteristics I dont really care Because the topic of this blog is actually the disadvantage that he faced the other day We were talking and he was expressing his frustration about a conversation he had had where someone informed him that he could not understand what it was like to be a minority You may agree with this statement and maybe for the average person in his situation that might be true but Andrew has chosen multiple times in his life to live outside of his comfort zone He has visited India for several months Mexico and Colombia Now did I mention that Andrew is white I am going to mention it one more time because Andrew is not just white he is white seriously sometimes in the winter we have actually debated whether or not he was glowing and it is hardly any better in the summer sorry Andrew In the crowds in foreign countries he sticks out like a sore thumb his presence screams at passersby to badger him grab him literally and to laugh at him Now he may be able to walk through an airport and not be stopped or to move from country to country with much more ease than the average he may even be able to get higher paying jobs or all the things that we know go along with his privilege but Andrew does know something about being minority the stares the whispers the grabbing no Im not kidding just ask him the story sometime and the constant badgering for money

One huge thing blogging has done for me personally is not only to help me work on my communication skills but to organize my thoughts Sometimes when I have a conversation about something I have already blogged about I refer people to my blog because they can get a greater understanding for what my thoughts are It shows them a series of thought there for a journal or school of thought that they might be able to relate to

My best friend and I do exactly that consciously when we work out together Its like a tug of war We set a goal of lunges for example and we absolutely have to do or looking each other in the eye making sure that we push ourselves so hard that we both clench our teeth and groan with the muscle pains I guess its un poco loco but it gets the job done We leave the gym on shaky legs sweat dripping off our red faces panting hard but with this astounding sense of achievement and pride and feeling good about our bodies

This uniqueness does not always lead to the most compelling read Scourge is the definition of a slow burn beginning in a small faceless town continuing with long stretches of reflection over barely textured wilderness and ending without a denouement that genre readers have come to expect Even the prose shows more workmanlike efficiency than dazzling style opting to preserve Arkis status as a painfully average chronicler Despite that I found myself coming back to it every night The haunting nature of Killcoin and Arkis revelatory witnessing of his life carries the novel delivering one of the most unique fantasy reading experiences Ive had
Do not lead people with unrealistic dreams without warning them and preparing them against the most urgent most immediate threats to their very lives Having dreams and ideals of secession and selfdetermination without even having considered the possibility of mass genocide is ignorant foolish and irresponsible it is a sin in any religion
He goes on to argue that as an observant Jew Jesus would have prayed the traditional prayers though I think he is actually confusing postChristian rabbinical practice with that of the time of Jesus in an effort to make yet another bash on the ordination of women Still we know that Jesus and his parents obeyed the Old Law in that he was duly circumcised made the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem and so forth That would be because they were in fact divinely instituted laws as the Old Testament makes clear binding on the people of the Old Covenant albeit not on Jesus himself
The rule of thumbone of the few suggestions from successful selfpubbed writers that actually seems to workis to not waste much time on marketing your latest release Instead use that time for writing your next book I have done that with The Hollows and the sales for the book show the lack of attention I have been giving it
What seems to escape their perception is that the passive voice was invented for a reason It describes a particular angle on a situation that focuses on the experience of being the recipient of an action not on the experience of the agent but rather on the experience of the subject being exposed to the action In any case there is a clear reason for the fact that our language still allows us to use the passive voice

Race may be a social construction but it continues to have real consequences upon peoples lived experiences I know that my experiences as a biracial Asian American boy growing up in the Los Angeles of the s s and early s I graduated from high school just a few scant months after the National Guard used our blacktop as a staging area will be very different from my daughters experiences as multiethnic Asian American girls growing up in a more conservative more homogeneous Central Valley in the early st century But I know that having a biracial black man in the White House and mixed folks a Hollywood trend doesnt equal the end of racism and that colorblindness leaves us unable to see and that sometimes it isnt enough to just love our children and hope for the best but that we must equip them with the lessons of our past the tools with which they can shape their world and our guidance with which they can learn to do so

This is the tragedy of the Iranian Revolution of After the mobilization of masses of Iranians toppled the authoritarian regime of the Shah the Islamists led by Khomeini outmaneuvered other democratic secular leftwing forces and seized power The mullahs initiated a counterrevolution that pushed the country in a regressive direction back towards the restoration of a feudal theocratic rule of which the only thing new is its being propped up by the worst modern instruments of state repression

Reed and Gerry down at the music I think this is from Thursday night This evening Reed really wanted to go home early We hadnt quite gotten into the groove of going down for the music yet so we had forgotten to bring toys snacks and jammies for him I was torn Part of me feared that if we went back early that night that hed want to go back early every night and I knew that neither G nor I was going to be excited to miss the music for the next few nights But I also worried that if I made him stay it would take all the fun out of it and he wouldnt want to come to the music any more But when I stopped and considered how unprepared we were I decided to go back to camp It turned out fine and we stayed for all the music after that

Ive noticed that there often seems to be a favourable connection between birds and fashion Bird prints grace fabrics and sustainably sourced vintage feathers prove a fine trim or texture for all manner of garments The image of Ginger Rogers swirling across the set clad in ostrich feathers in Top Hat demonstrates just how seductive a material they are The bird is also an appropriate metaphor for the process of dressing especially when concentrating on colourful and exuberant wardrobes Many of us are creatures who myself included enjoy choosing and showing off our plumage Tassels trims sequins buttons and ribbons are all forms of adornment Aside from the practicality of dressing for warmth the human body presents a myriad of ways to be clothed and decorated Unlike birds we change these feathers on a daytoday basis transitioning from sparrows to parakeets according to mood or whim

Barely PM it was prime feeding time for birds who were crowded at the feeder The sound of hundreds of happy songbirds was simply gorgeous And then I noticed a clematis that had flopped over and tied it back up and the more I stayed outside tending to my neglected gardens the more I realized what I have been missing by not slowing down and appreciating all the beauty around me As I weeded and deadheaded it occurred to me that perhaps my desire to buy new makeup is a based on a love of color I dont need to buy stuff that clutters my home and my mind when I can enjoy all the beauty that nature has to offer

Cally sees herself continuing to write short stories as well as novels and sees advantages to both With novels youve got more freedom and a lot more words to flesh out your characters she says I get to know my characters so well when Im writing a novel that theyre like real people to me Because youve spent so much time with them you grow to care for them which makes it much harder to throw obstacles in their path and do horrible things to them Its important that you find something likeable or fascinating in the case of the baddies in the characters in your novels because you have to spend so much time with them Characters in short stories are more like snap shots than fullyrounded characters but on the plus side with short stories youre constantly creating new characters and dipping into their lives

I had a hospital appointment this morning with a new consultant Given the many years and many ways Ive heard the popular diagnosis of its all in your head prior to being diagnosed with a very definitely not in my head genetic collagen disorder it is safe to say new doctors make me anxious Hospitals nurses and early mornings also make me anxious so I was grumpy and stressed before the appointment and very probably predisposed to tantrums Spotting a doctor who had previously been so convinced Id made up my diagnosis of EDS that he decided Id faked the official diagnosis letter included with my notes stressed me out further even though I knew I wasnt seeing him Listening to an elderly disabled mans welfare woes in the waiting room was also a joy Especially the bit where he told me that people who get full benefits get all the services they need I rather icily informed him that I receive full benefits but share the exact same challenges he faces in accessing social care support and inwardly wept at the outstanding political success of the saint vs scrounger rhetoric

AIM was formed in I and it grew spectacularly in the Is Its annual income rose from in II to I million in the early Is with funding mainly from large corporations and the wealthy heirs and foundations of the corporate system At least eight separate oil companies were contributors to AIM in the early Is but the wide representation in sponsors from the corporate community is impressive The function of AIM is to harass the media and put pressure on them to follow the corporate agenda and a hardline rightwing foreign policy It presses the media to join more enthusiastically in Redscare bandwagons and attacks them for alleged deficiencies whenever they fail to toe the line on foreign policy It conditions the media to expect trouble and cost increases for violating rightwing standards of bias

So as I see it at the core of how something like MT can work are fundamental ideas The first is the mistaken notion that the mind is a separate entity to the body and the traditional sense of the conscious mind as being the real self and the primary authority is dangerously nave as described in the previous posts The second is the understanding of the plasticity of the brain how we respond and how we act lay down and reinforce connections and pathways and if we change our understandings and actions then we can rewire aspects of the brain

Kris says that teachers in the US would teach for example mastery of an algorithm while Chinese teach the mastery of a concept She then says how MEP is aligned with this way of teaching the concept and mastering it and that will help you through other lessons For example if a student learns why you multiply two digits the way we do for all possible cases the Chinese teachers would tell you the students should and would figure out by themselves how to do it with three four and ten digits If you just learned how to proceed with a two digit multiplication and did drills a few months after you may very well make the mistake of forgetting how to align the results correctly because you just memorized that rule to multiply without mastering the principles of multiplication and the mistake wont jump in front of your eyes

I should not be satisfied with the legislation which you suggest I feel that it would only be tinkering with what is really becoming a fundamental problem for us all though it is only beginning to push its ugly head above the surface of politics The figures which we have been given make it clear that we are faced with a problem which though at at present it may be only a cloud the size of a mans hand may easily come to fill the whole political horizon Indeed if something is not done to check it now I should not be at all surprised if the problem became quite unmanageable in twenty or thirty years time We might well be faced with very much the same type of appalling issue that is now causing such great difficulties for the United States The main causes of this sudden inflow of blacks is of course the Welfare State So long as the antiquated rule obtains that any British subject can come into this country without any limitation at all these people will pour in to take advantage of our social services and other amenities and we shall have no protection at all
I read all my submissions personally and I cant see this changing anytime in the future Id worry too much about something amazing being missed Also after spending over year interning and buried in slush daily I really enjoy reading subsyou never know what youre going to find
We grow up desperate for validation For confirmation that being us is OK and if that confirmation doesnt come then we look around for a suitable person to be a role model And over the years we overwrite many areas of our uniqueness with the characteristics of others We become copies of others for good or ill

At the more macabre end of this scale is the recent documentary aired in China which interviewed inmates on death row for a reality TV show According to the BBC Interviews Before Execution first broadcast on Henan Legal Channel in November and interviewed a prisoner on death row every week before it was cancelled after government intervention It may make for unpalatable viewing but it is telling evidence that values in China arent the same as they used to be

Years ago under the Apartheid government the South African government set up a road fund which was funded by a fuel levy As a result we had worldclass roads throughout the country When the ANC came into power they stole all the money from these types of funds which were set up to maintain the existing infrastructure Then they closed their eyes and hoped that the infrastructure would take care of itself Of course it didnt and soon the electricity infrastructure came crashing down leading to electricity blackouts across the country which still continues today During Apartheid South Africa sold most of the extra generated electricity to other African countries as they had an oversupply of cheap abundant electricity Today the ANC cant even supply enough electricity to keep the country going The next shameful ANC looting episode occurred in where over R billion was wasted on the Arms Deal fiasco where a peaceful South Africa bought billions of dollars in military weapons and machinery that they apparently just had to have Of course a lot of the money was used to pay off bribes and for the ANC to pocket via a rerouted payment process and the weapons and machinery lie wasted today apparently not needed anymore There have been so many examples of waste corruption and stealing by the ANC too many to mention The Soccer World Cup is another classic example where the SA tax payers are still paying for the white elephant stadiums that lie unused but where the ANC and their pals pocketed money through the tender process for the stadiums The SWC which was supposed to put South Africa on the map and instead impoverished the people even more The latest ANC scam is the eToll controversy where the ANC has used State pension money to fund a Rbillion road upgrade in Johannesburg The ANC eager to continue with their pillaging of the country set up a front company called SANRAL SANRAL funded the upgrade with R billion from the State pension funds without their permission an upgrade which was supposed to be part of the infrastructure plans of the Soccer World Cup After this vast spendathon on already built roads the government informed everyone that the new roads would be toll roads with an eToll money collection system Everyone is now naturally outraged as tax payers have already paid for these roads via the still existing road fund Now they have to pay twice the second time via toll monies collected by SANRAl Once SANRAL pays back the borrowed pension monies they of course get to pocket the interest for the rest of their lives COSATU the biggest labour union in South Africa and also a government partner of the ANC acted all outraged and shouted for strikes and mass actiononly until it was revealed that they were part of the SANRAL consortium They have now postponed any strike action against the toll road for a month until the court case has been resolved yeah COSATU pull the other one why dont you And this story keeps getting better SANRAL have appointed a Swedish company to run the eToll system to the tune of over a Rbillion PER YEAR in collection costs Yes not a few million but over a billion EACH YEAR Hows that for pay back to the Swedes for their support for the ANC during Apartheid Now that the people are angry and openly hostile to the ANC the ANC have run to the courts trying to legalise this stealing of public money and trying to get the courts to force people to pay the tolls Ahhh the ANC champions of the Black man in Africa How the liberals the world over were taken for fools The ANC were only ever interested in getting their grubby paws on the riches of the country so they could live in luxury their fellow Black man And in the rest of the world the liberals sit back smoking their big fat victory cigars clapping each other on another hatchet job well done
I have a pile of possible first projects for todays Stash Bash and as I was looking through bins for some fabric to make what I thought would be this weeks project I found a bag full of half finished crochet projects with half written patterns pinned or stuffed into them This is me I think I have CADD craft attention deficit disorder I wake up to an idea which I must bring to fruition so I start crocheting and writing and scratching out followed by ripping out more scratching out and writing some minor bad language frustration and then I stash it away where the guilt of giving up wont find me

In my opinion based on my experience this is what makes a consultant worth such a high hourly rate Its not just anybody who can present charts with footnote references that will prove whatever the client wants proven Consultants who do not do this do not continue to get customers for years and years Who would pay for the unvarnished truth when unvarnished truth is intuitively obvious Of course Im not saying this particular consulting company delivered the message bought by its clients Im just saying my personal experience as an executive who hired consultants was that I paid for a specific message delivery On the other hand is it reasonable to conclude that biotech reduced pesticide use by comparing it to what might have happened had no one ever figured out that there are other ways to farm than spraying poisons

To take an example many parents have read and reread books with their very young children Most such children at any age between say and will start to ask what this or that says They will point at words and letters and try to say them As youre reading with them they may ask you or you may run your finger over the words If you leave gaps they will say the word that youre not saying because they have heard you say it before If you substitute another word they will tell you If you leave them with that book and many more you will hear them saying the book outloud some of the time because they remember you saying it some of the time because they find the word on the page Sometimes you hear them take that reading of the word to another text and find that word in another text In other words they read that word or words somewhere else

Well of course we shall accept that It is without doubt true However it does not explain anything at all When the baby is born this wiring is not really in place The neurones are all there and they are getting ready to make the connections It is quite true that in the case of children with ADHD or dyslexia the wiring is sometimes although not always a little different How did this come to be Was it a predetermined response to the genetic instructions or was it caused by the first years of life and the lifestyle of the developing infant Or which is far more likely was it a subtle combination of both Might it be that the newborn baby had a slight inclination in a certain direction an inclination which the early environment might bring out and allow to flourish

Talented Chinese employees increasingly recognize the benefits of being associated with a wellknown foreign brand and like the mentorship and training that foreign companies can provide So multinationals that commit themselves to developing meaningful career paths for Chinese employees should have a chance in the growing fight with their Chinese competitors for RD talent Initiatives might include inhouse training courses or apprenticeship programs perhaps with local universities General Motors sponsors projects in which professors and engineering departments at leading universities research issues of interest to the automaker That helps it to develop closer relations with the institutions from which it recruits and to train students before they graduate

Damien Hirst had a simelar concept with his butterfly piece where you are in a room with butterfly cocoons stuck to the canvases where you watch them hatch and fly and feed and die with the flying living butterflies all around you Again I have been inside a an artwork Of course there was loads of his other famous work there such as the shark halfed cow and butterfly collages The one that stirred me most was that of a white dove with spread out wings suspended for eternity Where Damien saw hope in this piece I found it rather unsettling and the dove seemed to blame me personally for its situation and seemed to say Look at me like all the others do I am destined to be looked and marvelled at forever without ever feeling the wind in my feathers again Shame on you humanity

He heard the wind chimes tinkle and come to life with the warm afternoon breeze They were soft at first rousing him fully from his late afternoon nap and then louder and more persistent refusing to be ignored Damn the day I ever hung those things he muttered softly Words to fill the silent room not intended to be heard by anyone else The truth was that day had been a perfect day He never heard the wind chimes melody without being reminded of how perfect it had been He rubbed his face not wanting to relive the memory that he knew was coming

The turn out for this street fair was massive around people Oddly enough we did just about as good as we do at the Portland Saturday market I was a bit bummed at a few moments when i realized that not having a way to accept credit cards had cost us around in sales that day So yesterday i figured a way to remedy the issue Apparently many art vendors have it set up so that they can take credit card payments through their smartphone through a device called square up Honestly I have desperately tried to resist the smartphone movement but here we are I guess I called my service provider who informed me I was due for an upgrade and that I could get the Pixi smartphone for free and then download the software that will allow me to take credit card payments on the go So I should have the phone before this weekend and I am very interested to try it out and see if the new capabilities will improve sales

We began with a modest three room spa on Yonge and Eglinton Yonge Street which we still have This spa has a retail area in the front that walkins could purchase natural skincare and cosmetics from It was a tough start because this was over ten years ago and most people had not learnt about the importance of avoiding chemicals in their cosmetics But we did have a fierce devoted core group of regular customers They were mostly made up of hypersensitive skinned people who could only use soothing natural products We were able to develop with their support

And Well Id call it cute and completely forgettable except perhaps for the loveliness of Marion Cotillard as everyones love interest and the outrageousness of Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali The best performance by far was by Paris herself the images of the city were picture postcard perfect and I really had to resist saying Ive been there And there And there And so while the script even with its flights of fancy is predictable Im guessing that youll still leave with a smile on your face If youre not in Paris you might be figuring out how to get here at any cost And for those of us who are Well it was a good reminder to go out and take a midnight stroll through the city something that beats the price of admission even when its on special
my father was a pathologist and I know that these standard blood tests are done by machines Yes they need the lab techs to put the blood in the vials or tubes or whatever and put them in the machines and push the start buttons but these are basically automated actions There is no legitimate reason for these common tests to cost so much Judging by the fact that they charged me for a pill we paid for at the pharmacy and the almost for the tetanus shot and the for TSH thyroid that costs me less than half that and includes a cholesterol panel as well when I get it done at the doctors office I think I can say with certainty that these

A while ago I wrote a post about young drivers being charged a painful amount on their insurance and how I thought it was unfair But if a much harder test has been introduced shouldnt this mean that our younger drivers are getting a better education behind the wheel and have more knowledge of the Highway Code In my opinion I dont think anyone really learns how to drive until theyve passed their test and are driving the car completely on their own with no backseat drivers no instructors and no one reminding them to indicate check their mirror slow down etc It isnt surprising that insurance companies are charging so much though because if a new driver doesnt have the experience then surely they have more chance of causing an accident On the other hand if I were to take my test again I couldnt be sure Id pass and I reckon that goes for many others

It may be the curriculum Look at the nearest public school for this one All teachers must teach to the curriculum no exceptions alternatives or workarounds And in recent years the curriculum has been strongly driven by standardized tests and the need to score well on them This is even more pathetic than the basic idea of curriculum design where a bunch of soi disant experts get together to arbitrarily decide on what goes into the curriculum and what doesnt Man I am so reminded of the Council of Nicea huh Orthodoxy orthodoxy is our cry Orthodoxy Are we in it Well I guess Orthodoxy orthodoxy yes yes yes

Back to the Amsterdam I saw however it was a funny experience in much the same way it can be funny watching a child figure out how to work a doorknob or something simple like that While someone may move to try and help them after a while the goodhumored person would invariably hold the other back with a halfcovered smirk saying no nolet him figure it out with an altruistic show of tough love masking their inward amusement Just so imagine yourself in Amsterdam again this time seated in an Italian restaurant enjoying a cold glass of water and a pizza margherita Look to your left Now back to your right Now look left again What do you see If the answer was a group of four unnaturally hungry friends with three of them wearing large eyecovering sunglasses chances are theyre high as heaven If your answer was a group of three girls and one guyall Americanone with a residual cough and all of them with an unnaturally good sense of humor chances are that theyve taken some breathing exercises in the local Bulldog Coffeeshop as well In fact as you imagine yourselves in the streets of Amsterdam theres about a in chance that the next person you see is under the effects of some mindaltering drug as all the symptoms would indicate But thats alright I only recalled my friends account of his trip to Amsterdam admittedly as one of the drug tourists but dont hold that against him and how mostly all of the locals who talked to him did so with condescending tones and overlyplayed smiles asking questions like yeah are you having a good time in Amsterdam I felt like a local in how I started to see Americans by the end of the trip Its no wonder that the Netherlands are trying to push for cracking down on drug tourismdespite the financial implications of that

If we stay alert to the fact that individual nouns and particularly abstract nouns routinely turn out to refer to distinguishable things we can sometimes clear the smoke away a bit from philosophical arguments For example ethical theorists perhaps not the best ethical theorists but quite a few ethical theorists might see themselves as involved in some sort of partisan contest are the rights theorists correct or better or what have you or are the consequentialists the ones who are giving us the best account of things Or maybe virtue theory is preferable to both Certainly philosophers working on ethical theory are frequently identified as rights theorists or as consequentialists Im a consequentialist is taken to mean not only that one endorses consequentialism but also that one declines to endorse the other types of ethical theory on offer

Why do we have to beg white society for the rights that are supposed to be inherent Explicitly our right to LIFE our right to LIBERTY This is the America black people knowthe one where we have to beg those who oppress us to stop long enough for us to get to our feet the one where we have to beg white people to see it in their hearts to prosecute someone who is CLEARLY guilty of a hate crime Trayvon Martin was LYNCHED and life went back to normal for the Zimmermans the black community then had to get on its knees and work really work beg for the attention of white run news stations and white reporters and white run justice departments to do what they are SUPPOSED TO DO report prosecute uphold the law protect the RIGHTS of human beings Why do people of color have to beg these institutions for rights that are inherent What is it about being a black person in America that makes the news the judicial system and society disregard you as nonhuman Everyone is so gungho about this being America they love to recite our bill of rights until black people ask to be protected under them Life is an unalienable rightbut if youre black you have to ask white people to grant that right to you White people should have NEVER had the power to grant black people rights they should have NEVER had the power to deny them But the reality is that since slavery white people have held the rights of black people in the palm of their hands and they pass out justice when they feel like it and I guess in the case of Trayvon Martinthey didnt feel like it until this teenager was cold and dead for a month I say begging the structure for justice again because this is not the first nor will it be the last time we have to find white people to get behind us in order to get justice This is not going to be the last time we have to beg new stations and papers to put out a story on behalf of a victim of murder and hate

LAST YEAR yet another official report was produced this time by Sir Peter North proposing the reduction of the UK drinkdriving limit from mg to mg This offered no new evidence and earlier this year it was rejected by Transport Secretary Philip Hammond arguing that the vast majority of drinkrelated road deaths involve drivers well over the current limit and cutting the limit by itself would do nothing to change their behaviour For the first time an official response on the issue actually acknowledged the potential effect on the hospitality trade Licensees and customers of rural suburban and small town pubs will no doubt have felt considerably relieved by this decision

Its time to rethink Sarah Palin From the moment that Republican presidential candidate John McCain plopped her on his ticket the supreme article of political faith from all pundits much of the press most Democrats and the GOP establishment has been that Sarah Palin is a laughingstock a sideshow diversion an ignoramus on the issues a gossip and celebrity starved media creation and of course a closet race tinged crowd baiter The Palin allure is built squarely on elements of these features But whats now painfully obvious is the allure has turned Palin into a political force threat and danger

Now this conversation can go a few ways and you have to be prepared to deal with the repurcussions Either the customer will get it apologize and grab whatever cash is in their pocket and leave it on the bar as a tip Or the customer could just be a complete jerk who doesnt tip and just walks away Then there are the customers who dont speak a lick of English and dont understand what youre saying so they just smile and walk away

Perhaps Tati is present in the film In addition to a brief scene featuring Mon Oncle playing in an old theater Chomet has captured TatiHulots postures gait and mannerisms perfectly The magician carries an umbrella and even wears the same bowtie and raincoat and in one scene even has the hat of Mr Hulot The magician has the same awkward secondguess step and toetilting rigidity and balance that Mr Hulot possessed His hands always find their way to his hips or outstretched innocently behind him The magician is a lovingly molded caricature Where the characters in Triplets and Old Lady were hilariously grotesque exaggerations the characters of The Illusionist seem to be sculpted with more compassion Much like Walle the magicians relative silence and absence of a wide range of facial expression do not hinder the audience from understanding exactly what is transpiring in that little animated brain His quiet demeanor only give us more understanding of his plight and give him more sympathy

On Sunday I spent a lovely day out in the sunshine with Wesat Goodwood Festival of Speed Oh yes I thought that my willingness to accompany my love to such a blokey borefest meant that I must be the best girlfriend in the entire world only to be horrified to find that there were wives and girlfriends absolutely everywhere And I think some of the women there werent even wives or girlfriends at all but had just mosied along of their own accord Not a bad move if theyre single

I made my first silent films in on actual film and have made several forays into the form over the ensuing decades a new batch is in the works in conjunction with my new book Chain of Fools due out September This of course makes me both the best and the worst sort of audience for something like The Artist and if I was the only one Id feel bad about it A prescreening canvas of my friends about the film proved to be a catalog of nitpicking A graphic designer friend said the font in the titles was all wrong A silent film scholar friend said no the fonts were correct but the kerning and justification were all off A friend whos a fashion historian said the costumes drove her crazy Me I picked out an airplane that was from the wrong period and thought much of the music and some of the camerawork seemed anachronistic

I always complete the minute warmup and the minute cooldown but I have yet to finish the main K set as specified Even using slower intervals than recommended I tire quickly I often slow the belt down or complete fewer intervals or both Still Im getting a good workout My heart rate easily reaches the performance zone of max during the speed intervals During the rest intervals if I feel like I need more recovery I walk until my heart just drops out of the aerobic zone and then start the next speed lap I keep telling myself just one more speed interval until I simply cannot complete any more and then I begin the cooldown I aim to complete a total of at least miles including warmup and cooldown

When one party moves this far from the mainstream it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the countrys challengesHowever like Think Progress I thought the pairs advice to media at the end was equally important and deserves much more attention We understand the values of mainstream journalists including the effort to report both sides of a story But a balanced treatment of an unbalanced phenomenon distorts reality If the political dynamics of Washington are unlikely to change anytime soon at least we should change the way that reality is portrayed to the public

Heres how it worksyou play with other people it can be friendsfamily or people you dont know from anywhere in the world to earn coins which I could care less about the coins You can choose easy for coin medium for coins and hard for coins The subject you have to draw is next to whichever level you choose Using your finger you draw a simple or detailed image when finished you send it to whomever you chose to play with When they open their app they will see that you sent them something They open it and try to figure out what youve drawnthere are scrambled letters under the image that they use to spell out their answer If they get it wrong they try again and again until they figure it out It really is fun oh and the best part is when you receive a drawing from someone and open it up it actually draws it right then so you can see the steps the other person took in creating their drawing FUN FUN FUN

Maya Angelous autobiographical offering The Heart of a Woman not to be confused by the exhibition of Harlequin covers of the same name is not the most appropriate selection for a book club for the simple reason that it is book four of a fivebook autobiography and none of the other books are on the list So it is actually very difficult to assess Angelous book entirely out of context but this review shall attempt to do so as its goal is to assess books within the context of Oprahs Book Clubs list

But you say again If the pope is as bad as the Turk and you yourself call him Antichrist together with his clergy and his followers then the Turk is as godly as the pope for he acknowledges the four Gospels and Moses together with the prophets must we not then fight the pope as well as the Turk or perhaps rather than the Turk Answer I cannot deny that the Turk holds the four Gospels to be divine and true as well as the prophets and also speaks very highly of Christ and His mother but at the same time he believes that his Mohammed is above Christ and that Christ is not God as has been said above We Christians acknowledge the Old Testament as divine Scripture but now that it is fulfilled and is as St Peter says in Acts too hard without Gods grace it is abolished and no longer binds us

People are usually happy with the concept of a painting telling a story that can be interrupted in a number of ways and accept that a quick glance isnt enough you have to stand in front of it for a while whilst you personalise the meaning So why then do we struggle when a novel works in the same way when the writer uses words to paint images directly into a readers head to tell a story in a way that needs time to sit within their mind

Being straight white male upperclass ablebodied etc is not a default state for human existence Its therefore unreasonable to expect people who do not meet those criteria or at least several of them to experience creative works solely or primarily through characters who do There is no such thing as an Everyman who has experiences that are truly universal Attempts at boosting equality that attempt to genericize people to a standard set by a privileged ruling class are at best misguided and do nothing to actually improve things for people in marginalized groups

For me this case comes right on the heels of reading about the similarly disconcerting execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas under the seemingly disinterested eye of current GOP darling Rick Perry If you havent heard about this case you should definitely read all the sordid details here Willingham was convicted and put to death for the murder by arson of his three children The problem here is that the scientific evidence used at trial was to be polite half assed Several examinations of the evidence both before and after Willinghams execution found that there was no credible evidence to support the assertion that arson even occurred The obvious implication is that you cant very well murder anyone by arson if you didnt actually burn the place down

Somehow I think when taking pictures vertically or framing a photo in the portrait mode a photographer is forced to focus more deeply in getting depth and perspective of the scenery as best as can be Also I think the camera sensor is being made to read more contrasting lights from the bottom frame to the top frame and somehow make the best of the lighting conditions

The casting is plain odd Dane Cook Kevin Costner and Demi Moore together in a movie is just surreal and I have to say some of the acting is a bit shaky and the only reason why this isnt an out and out modern classic Sometimes they get a bit dull in Costner and Hurts cases or melodramatic in Moores case can she possibly grit her teeth any more and Dane Cook is pretty annoying But most of the time it doesnt offend too much and everyone does seem really into what theyre doing even when the performances are a little on the Bgrade side

I have to hand it to JWs coach though Last night when our pitcher was about to fall apart because the other coach kept yelling balk our coach told him that he didnt care how many times they called balk or how many runs scored his only desire was for the kid to have fun Despite the fact that we were losing and that we have other pitchers who might have been able to do better he just let the boy finish out the game and then congratulated him on how he played That little boys feelings were more important to him than the outcome of the game Then after the game they were able to talk to the umpire and get a lesson on how to pick off a runner on third without getting called for a balk

True true Tommy agreed However it is amusing in a sense that one can profess to be Catholic while disagreeing with parts of Church teaching While disregarding the pontiff While supporting same marriageor abortion There is such disjunction between their beliefs and their actions one wonders if theyre thinking at all And how is it possible for them to maintain composure when they make such claims I believe I would laugh to their faces at such blatant displays of ignorance Charitably of course

A more feasible hypothesis is perhaps that different types of white oak have been used in the different cases or that the treatments employed have been different A cask made from newly felled unseasoned white oak of an unsuitable species is sure to give violently disagreeable flavours when it is filled with beer no matter what preliminary treatment may have been employed to minimise this We have had personal experience of casks of this type and we can testify that even when lined pickled and treated by every known trick they will continue to contaminate every lot of beer with which they are filled until they are eventually broken down and thrown away Even one stave of timber of this kind is enough to taint the whole contents of the cask

Much of the tax the rich rhetoric is misleading or false in other ways than just the confusion between wealth and income Modern liberals also constantly complain that the rich are not paying their fair share There are many ways all subjective to define fair share eg equal percentage of income equal percentage of wealth a progressive tax system etc so asking if the rich pay their fair share is a pointless exercise Even the same data can suggest contradictory answers as to whether or not the rich are paying their fair share depending on ones definition of fair share For example a sociology professor at UCSC recently published an analysis of wealth and income distribution which demonstrates that the wealthiest Americans are accumulating a larger and larger share of wealth On the other hand the same analysis shows that Americans with the highest income tend to pay a higher share of all taxes

As a proud Dick I would like to express my disgust and outrage at the cheap joke made at the expense of Mr Dick Pole the pitching coach of the Chicago Reds Although Im English and dont understand a thing about pitching it means something else here in North London and I could never see the need to coach teach what comes so naturally to young boys of a certain age Im certain that Dick Pole is good at his job and doesnt deserve such ridicule I am also sure that his friends and family would stand firmly beside Mr Pole to show the world a united front against such cheap Dick shots

Overall Wrights work is not a light read After about the fifth poem the reader realizes they arent going to get away with just flying through the poem halfheartedly and be rewarded Wrights work forces its readers to meditate and chew on what theyve just read What is apparent is that Wright through his endless exploration of the essence of man has garnished some wisdom over the years that is passed along through his poetry This a collection as much of Wrights work for those who arent afraid to ask some of lifes bigger questions

Hurrah To most people this little sample of garter stitch is no big whoop but to me this is a massive achievement I attempted to learn how to knit when I was ten and failed miserably I just couldnt get my head round it And for the following years even the simple task of casting on evaded me I dont know what it was knitting dyslexia maybe but the directions in all the books I read just didnt make sense In the end I learnt to chrochet which made more sense and from that I was able to translate knitting guides Then finally it clicked Sort of Its still a huge learning challenge for me and doesnt come naturally at all BUT its a lesson in how I can learn creativity as well as be naturally gifted

We finally discover exactly what Kukaku Shibas plan is to get the Ryoka into the seireitei Shes going to use a massive cannon to shoot them over the seireiteis walls However there is an invisible forcefield around the walls and the ryoka have to learn how to focus their kido spiritual energy into a specially designed sphere that will allow them to pass through the forcefield rather than explode on impact Everyone but Ichigo picks up the trick quickly enough although when he finally learns how to do it his massive kido nearly destroys the practice space until he figures out how to decrease it to manageable levels While all of this is going down the thirteen captains of the Soul Society are holding a meeting to determine the fate of Gin Ichimaru for allowing the ryoka to escape alive He tries to play dumb but its obvious that what he did was a grave offense to the other captains and that he knows more than hes letting on Their meeting is interrupted however by an alarm declaring intruders in the seireitei which Im assuming were supposed to think means the ryoka but I have a suspicion that there are other forces at play When its finally time to shoot the ryoka over the seireitei things are going according to plan until the group actually hits the barrier where their shield dissolves and the group is split into four parties and shot in separate directions into the seireitei The four groups are Ichigo and Ganju Orihime and Uryu Chad and Yoruichi with Chad having basically sacrificed his ability to be with the group to make sure Orihime and Uryu were together

Our culture teaches us that we are each autonomous individuals who are only responsible for our own wellbeing We end up believing that we are independent creatures who should make our own way in life without depending on others In reality we all rely on each other for our daily existence We eat food that grows in soil nurtured by microscopic organisms We drink water that has vaporized from the oceans we breathe oxygen respired by the trees and wear clothing made by people across the planet whom we will never meet We rely on our friends and family for support and create a sense of belonging and meaning within our communities Our personal wellbeing is inextricably linked to the wellbeing of our families our friends our communities and our planet And the wellbeing of others in turn is shaped by our own wellbeing

To date Benedicts defenders have claimed that he really just didnt know that a priest in his diocese had simply been moved on to another parish That seems incredibly unlikely but it might just be possible though as I have said before if you believe that then Ive got a rather nice painted ceiling in a spiffy basilica in Rome to sell to you But this time letters were sent directly to him about abuse committed against boys at a school for the deaf by an American priest the Rev Lawrence C Murphy The priest was moved on and later on when a secret church process against him was started it was stopped

I like the early Gibson and Stephenson for what they are They used science fiction somewhat differently than other people did and were a little more grounded using our current reality as a point of departure or rather the ss reality Many of these stories while steeped in techno geek paradigms keep some of the sensibilities from the pulp science fiction wierdness that Philip K Dick so popularized More importantly though they carve their own path One of the awesome things about Philip K Dick was not that he was predicting the future but the entire future he created revolved around a number of eccentric conditions that may never possibly exist His main character conflicts are something that could only happen in a Dick novel but at once can be seen as a distorted mirror for aspects of our own strange trivialities This is why I love PKD but cyberpunk I enjoy in a completely different way Like in a comic book geek way as opposed to a th century literature way I can like both

These past few months of Crossfit have probably been the most challenging for me for a variety of reasons A changed environment for one The ridiculous winter here for another And while I am tremendously happy to be coaching and helping other folks move forward in their respective Crossfit journeys it has been very difficult to still prioritize my own training especially while working a regular job too But I would say the biggest obstacle has been my own ego I have been guilty of being overly concerned with other peoples numbers I have not wanted to not beat my own scores I have been hesitant to try going heavier even though I know I need to I have been afraid A little unmotivated Both

These gain his greatest attention Those more populated and dessicated elicit more disdain He wearies of his fellows and seeks solitude The character of a region has much to do with the character of the person describing it for we see our own heart in a landscape He connects his melancholy with his preference for the wild a wilderness becomes not just an entity but a state of imagination

That said then I do believe it needed for the societies to offer the opportunity for people of any faith to live according to that faith as far as they participate and accept the laws of the country We have an expression in the Talmud Dina Malchuta Dina the law of the land is the law Bava Kama a Bava Batra ba etal The extent of the principle is discussed among the Rishonim the medieval rabbis some stating that it is only related to financial matters where others state that it is in general where the law doesnt go against the Torah at least so far as it doesnt force people to go against the Torah For example should ritual slaughter be prohibited in Denmark it wouldnt mean that the Jews in Denmark would have to eat unkosher meat though it would make it hard for them to find and achieve kosher meat

Sadly our younger sisters are mistakenly thinking that by wearing hijaab in this fashion without thinking about the rest of their attire they are fulfilling one of their Islamic duties Dont get me wrong its good to see more and more sisters wearing hijaab But its time we got this right and looked at hijaab in the way the Wives of the Prophet pbuh adopted it they are our role models

One may say that this only mirrored the dreadful crimes Germany committed in Poland but I think thats a copout because those who suffered werent necessarily the guilty parties Neither the children who died in freezing cold railway carriages or the little girl with the bleeding feet deserved what happened to them Nor I think had my crusty old greatgrandfather from the mountains who hated the Nazis and having been deported at the age of ninety died in a displaced persons camp in the new East Germany refusing all my grandfathers attempts to bring him to the west because he couldnt believe hed never see his home again
One final thing I cant say too much now maybe more later Ive learned that I work with some people who arent exceptionally good communicators I had been told by professors that kicking students out of the classroom was often a sign to administrators that you couldnt control your classroom so I kept students in the classroom and things got out of hand When I talked to veteran teachers their advice way into the year Kick them out on the first day they act up You wont get any guff about it from anyone Had I known this earlier in the year I might have saved myself a lot of headache So one very simple lesson Ive learned is to ask questions and find reliable sources who will provide guidance and it seems like Ive got a lot of good stuff in that regard

But she maintains she is not on welfare She is however very much on public assistance since SSI is basically a welfare program for the disabled who are indigent which also brings Medicaid healthcare benefits with it hospitalization major medical and prescription assistance And she is on food stamps which she does not believe is welfare because she doesnt get a check every month And she is on Medicaid which is also not welfare in her eyes because she does not get a check every month But all these benefits are forms of public assistance funded by the taxpayers

Long ago on that indoor range over the hours we practiced whats called the Harries method This involves holding the flashlight in the offhand across the shooters body and resting the pistol to the left of the flashlight for right handed shooters with the wrist of the hand gripping the pistol laying on top of the other wrist In the olden days when all flashlights had their switch on the body in the traditional place the Harries method called for an uncomfortable positioning of the off hand upside down so the thumb could activate the switch While difficult to describe a few images will make the method clear Here is the Harries method adapted to a rear switched flashlight

As this weeks long day at the hospital progressed however I began to feel a bit guilty about my upgrade even to the point of feeling bad about my earlythirties skinnyjeaned shoulderlengthhaired presence in the chemo room which Ive got to say is a world away from the place in which I was treated in gone are the peeling yellow walls and uncomfortable edgeoftheroom chairs facing in now its all recliners and personal TV screens and fivestar style Even three years down the line Im still the youngest patient in the room but this time thankfully Im not there for chemo thats something that comes home with me and is taken in tablet form with the second cycle starting this evening but instead for my bone treatment Which is a rather daft thing to feel selfconscious about but as my fellow patients in the room begin to look iller and balder and paler as their chemo does its thing I will or at least I hope I will look much the same with every threeweekly visit like some kind of cheating chemo pretender
Im not going to do that Ill just get a phone off someone else until my upgrade wink

Much of our interview with Joan focused on issues surrounding independence which is understandable but many of her comments also tell us what the SNP are doing and plan to do for young people The policy that has garnered much media attention over the past couple of years is the SNPs free tuition fees policy The Scottish Government will pay for all young peoples tuition fees in Scotland which is a great relief on young people who spend much of their time worrying about personal issues and their finances The last thing they need is the burden of debt on their backs Many students who will come out of university in England in the coming years will face a minimum debt of thanks to their new tuition fee policy of per annum Loans they may take out for living costs throughout their student years will also add to this While they dont have to pay for their debt until they are earning over it is still a huge worry to hang over a students head who will no doubt be worrying about getting a job and decent accommodation

The movie kicks off strongly and initially looks like its going to play out like a noir picture A car is making its way along a stretch of road in Tunisia in the middle of a violent storm The rain is hammering down relentlessly and the darkness is closed in oppressively on all sides with only the headlights cutting a feeble path ahead Hunched in the gloom the driver squints through the rainstreaked windscreen and forges on By sheer luck he avoids running slap into a landslide thats taken out the road As he gets out to try to discover a way round the obstruction he comes upon a wrecked and abandoned truck His good fortune in avoiding an accident is revealed to be one of those sneaky tricks of fate when he finds that the truck was apparently part of a gun running operation This whole sequence takes place without a word of dialogue and the murkiness of a rotten night is only broken by the occasional flashes of lightning that draw attention to the important sights That wonderful atmosphere is retained as the tired and muddy traveller makes his way to the nearest town and the welcoming light of the local inn Its here that we learn his identity David Redfern Trevor Howard a British archaeologist sent to catalogue and collect some ancient artifacts including the golden salamander of the title before overseeing their shipping His close call on the washed out road has placed him in a perilous position though with the gun runners suspecting though at first not sure that hes seen something What draws him deeper into danger is his becoming romantically involved with the young proprietress of the inn Anna Anouk Aimee whose brother is part of the smuggling gang The plot is a straight thriller that sees Redfern first wrestling with indecision before resolving to take action when a tragic turn of events forces his hand Even then he has to face up to the fact that the town is a nest of corruption where its impossible to be sure who if anyone can be trusted

 Special deals and contests Ann Taylor for example is using Foursquare in a recent effort to harness social media platforms Their campaign specifically allows individuals that are mayors at specific locations in New York City to receive off of their total purchase Depending on the successful of their campaign they may even attempt to expand the approach to all stores nationwide Not to mention there are specific social media programs that will allow to trigger messages at specific times By having the option to schedule a message businesses can determine when they would like prospective customers to be made aware of certain information This means that social media in a sense is more tactical than ever

From police reports its clear that he shot Christine first from the side door of his house and then as he walked over to view her body that was face down in the grass he lifted his gun and shot her in the back I imagine just before he pulled the trigger he thought the words he told the police later It had to be done My mother was on the kitchen phone with the emergency operator reporting that Brooks had threatened their lives when Christine was first shot She immediately dropped the telephone ran outside and stood in front of Brooks weaponless I imagine she asked him why he did it and in answer he shot her just below the heart Brooks determined discriminatory attitude has troubled me ever since How did he become so certain about his decision to murder my mother and Christine After the deaths I watched in astonishment as the actual motivation for the crime was determined to be a property dispute instead of a hate crime Newspapers reported exaggerated stories casting my mother and Christine in a harsh light which apparently had nothing to do with their sexual preference

People believe in God because the world is very complicated and they think it is very unlikely that anything as complicated as a flying squirrel or the human eye or a brain could happen by chance But they should think logically and if they thought logically they would see that they can only ask this question because it has already happened and they exist

I have often asked myself the question What do I do when Im tempted to sin Its an important question considering the fact that we live as sinful people surrounded by other sinful people in a world where the devil is craftily seeking to lead us away from righteousness In the many moments each day when temptation is bearing down on us we need to know what to do in order to remain faithful to our gracious King But this question should not be left alone we should also ask What do I do when Im not being tempted that will help me when I am being tempted

The other decision circumcision I really talked to my husband about this decision and left it up to him Again I knew both sides of the argument However one thing I also knew is how a uncircumcised male felt Not Hubby but a high school boyfriend Even though we did not engage in sexual activity he once confided in me that his parents had not circumcised him He explained how he was embarrassed by this nervous for when he did engage in sexual activity and much more My husband had a point of view as the boy who was circumcised and as a rd grader used the bathroom next to a boy who was not He remembered the boy being embarrassed about it In the end we decided to circumcise our son I know the argument that they can choose to have it done as an adult but let us be honest no man is going to purposely inflict that kind of pain on himself Look how many are opposed to being sterilized because it makes them shudder Also the research on the amount of pain a baby feels compares to an adult I know there is research on both sidesbut I can now say from personal experience my son only cried for a few moments I nursed him and he never cried after that I also understand the effect it has for breastfeeding This is why my sons circ was not done in the hospital but a few weeks after his birth That said again I understand the point of view of leaving a boy intact

I wanted it to be fun to open but it is almost impossible to find pretty boxes and shipping materials I used a large box that a new pair of boots had come in at the beginning of winter I stamped some pretty coordinating paper and glued it to the inside of the box lid where a logo had been stamped from the boot company I lined the entire box with pink and white tissue paper Then I wrapped each item individually in stamped tissue paper I stamped the tissue paper with thank you and various birds flowers etc in different colors I wrapped each package with some fun fibers and then embellished them with some chipboard accents that coordinated with the pinks and whites I also took an acrylic star ornament and applied gesso let that dry then using a paper towel applied some pink ink and paint rubbed the paint and ink back and then glazed it Let it dry and tied it to one of the packages Once I had it all arranged in the box I added some of my cards my coupons a FREE bar of soap most of the time I will give out sample size soaps but this was a more costly order so I went with a free bar and a handmade card from me telling the customer how much I appreciated their business

Bruno was a workhorse to beat all workhorses He seemed to love work and would have no problem pulling the plow into place I should have let you do it to begin with Ricky said as he led Bruno out of the stall Suddenly Teddy and Bruno both were spooked Bruno began to stand high on his back legs kicking as he began to neigh with a whinny effect Brunos front legs hit the ground like thunder then he took of like a bolt of lightning Ricky looked around to see what was terrifying his animals It was a rattlesnake on the alarm and ready to strike Ricky ran to get his shotgun As he laid aim of the rattlesnake Teddy was becoming more and more anxious The rope was tied to the heavy steel plow and the plow was tied to Teddy He couldnt go far As the mule was moving farther away from the barn the pulley took the plow past the point it was intended to go Ricky shot at the snake but missed He aimed again However before the second shot could be fired Teddy jumped forward and the rope holding the plow snapped The plow began to fall toward the earth at rocket speed and it plummeted toward Ricky The plow carved a path through his body like a row in the garden as it cemented itself into the ground Summer came running to see what all the commotion was about When she saw Ricky lying there with the plow penetrating his body all she could do was scream as he laid there dying It was a horrible way for a young girl to realize the facts of life They were married a total of thirtyseven days when Ricky met his fate One month later Summer discovered she was pregnant with her first child A pregnant thirteen yearold widow is a rarity indeed

My question is in this current term in office since what have the Malay MPs done to improve the situation of at risk Malay youths As we can all see they have slacked and have delivered hardly any decent needed progress on this issue In fact one cannot recollect of any major measure that they had implemented Minister Yaacob still insist on claiming that progress has been made by Malay youths in education while the gaps between Malay youths and other ethnic groups remain alarmingly wide In fact there is also no indication of any cosmetic improvement in the educational outcomes of Malay youths

Technically his first screen appearance came during the opening bank robbery but to those of us assembled at the Moolah for the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight the Joker didnt really make an entrance until he came strolling into a mob meeting a few minutes later After months of feverish anticipation of Heath Ledgers already legendary performance the crowd was amped to respond to even the most simple onscreen affectation but nothing could have prepared us for his dispatchment of a grunt who happened onto the wrong end of a pencil To say that the place exploded would be an understatement it was the equivalent of Clark Gables revealing the bare chest beneath his shirt while dropping the bomb on Nagasaki In that one moment Heath exceeded all of his own hype and in the process set a new standard for cinematic malevolence that has kept us little fanboys in thrall ever since

Heading back upstream more trouble and we circle back to the floating house at the canoe berth and our longtail breaks down completely just as we edge up to it Our captain is shouting something angrily to the four of five people who stand unimpressed watching our approach He yells again and one of the women reluctantly goes into the backroom presumably the kitchen and returns with a meat cleaver We raise out eyebrows and look at each other again However all he decapitates is a water bottle The upper part is useful it appears and after some repairs obviously involving the introduction of some fluid or other we are off No more issues With bumps grinds and pushes and a great rearrangement of boats already berthed we negogiate with the other returning longtails and larger boats into a rare berth on the crowded sand

The climax of the film is a big sloppy mess that pretty much has tryhard written all over it They didnt have any actual atmosphere or scares so they put in a nearly unwatchable miasma of people screaming demonic faces flashy lights and other stuff that makes the movie look like a little kid screaming for attention because his mom and dad wouldnt buy him a Optimus Prime action figure Seriously this is wretched You have to TRY to be this bad

Watching the development of JGS and Yoonas modern times characters love story is very entertaining Compared to the s which was very withheld they express themselves better in the modern times making it much more fun and exciting to the viewers In case anyones wondering the love story of the s couple continues Whats sad is their the parents of the modern times kids so if ever they end up together the modern kids cant which is sad because theyre great with each other So currently the drama is in a point wherein the love story of the parents is getting in the way of the relationship of their children Hopefully though the director is famous for his tearjerking dramas Ill get more smiles out of this one

The Reichenbach Fall alludes to that spectacular encounter in the form of a supposedly priceless painting of the tall Swiss cascade which Holmes recovers near the beginning of this episode However the action in Reichenbach is firmly set in London where the detective is called to testify against the insane criminal mastermind Jim Moriarty played by Andrew Scott who has recently broken into the Tower of London and threatened the safety of the crown jewels on display After Moriarty is declaredagainst all reasonto be not guilty of this headlinemaking transgression he enters into a dangerous catandmouse game with Holmes determined to destroy the sleuths reputation and in the process prove that he Moriarty is the greater genius The plot turns here tumble upon one another making Holmes and Watson fugitives from the law and concluding with well I wont tell you how this outstanding episode ends except to say that it will leave you scratching your headin a good wayand looking forward to the third season of Sherlock

All of this began here with Aliens He still was creating a quality story backed by a few strong solid actors but he surely couldve tightened it up in areas during scripting Still what irritates me when watching this film are many of the technical issues with visual effects rear screen projection the photography of the miniatures and the poor choice of film stock Furthermore the poorly conceived Colonial Marines aside from Hicks are cartoonish buffoons that like to stroke their own egos instead of getting serious in a serious situation These are all elements that make a substantial negative impact upon the film for me It has plenty of good qualities to it from the strong lead performances and practical creature effects but with a film so long the negatives inevitably linger to repeatedly damage my enjoyment of the movie Maybe one day I will watch the theatrical version and feel differently about that shorter cut but if I was to judge this the way I intended it had to be the directors preferred version This is an off occasion where I didnt review the film for the sake of opening peoples eyes or rousing anyones interest It really was just so I could deconstruct what always bothered me about this movie and see the shortcomings that have prevented my full fledged enjoyment of it Im sure many would not perceive these same issues but if everyone had the same point of view on everything it would be a very uninteresting world

I didnt take any photos of her when they were singing as I couldnt see her very well But when all the performers came back onstage later on to do their body percussion piece I was able to snap this happy smiley shot The body percussion item was simply called Rain and the students used their hands and feet to create a sound like a rainstorm right from the first whispers of the wind rubbing their hands together to the opening sprinkles clicking their fingers and on to the heavier rain slapping their thighs In the middle of the downpour there was some startling sharp foot stamping which combined with the lights being flicked on and off looked and sounded just like thunder and lightening

Before a closer look at these musical numbers it may be fruitful to examine how the stage is literally set within Shock Corridor for these numbers to play out As a key element of the Hollywood musical in terms of creating a stage area proscenium arches are a primary visual motif throughout Shock Corridor literally turning the supposedly ordinary space of the hospital into performance arenas The Street what the inmates and staff call the corridor of the films title is obviously not a real street but rather a pantomime street Even its name denotes a space for theatrical activity The angular lines that connote perspective and depth within the corridor create a literal frame for the action on this pantomime stage Cathys I Want Somebody to Love sequence the films most overt musical number literally occurs on a stage in the nightclub in which she works The second musical number is the canteen sequence where the rhythm begun by Pagliaccis tablebashing as a fight over medication breaks out is framed again by an angular highcontrast grid pattern on the wall and ceiling that literally frames the action creating yet another stage Johnnys second nightmare in the hospital has a light supposedly coming from outside the window but that functions as a spotlight on his face and forms an arch above his head and as Pagliacci performs his opera the sequence is interspersed with audience fellow inmate reaction shots albeit that reaction is to be slumped over asleep Johnny and Trents Hari Rhodes steamboat mime sequence another powerful musical number begins not with a shot of them front on but rather in profile sitting to the edge of the shot while again the corridor itself creates a proscenium arch complete with a stupefied ballet of fellow inmates in the background And as Trent and Johnny lie in beds side by side in straight jackets the bed heads again make clear and distinct arches above their heads denoting the frame as a performance space The fight sequence between Johnny and Wilkes is laden with arches be it shadows in the hydrotherapy room or the airconditioning pipes in the kitchen as they arrive in The Street for the final confrontation there is again literally a spotlight on them The waterfall sequence is the films final ballet and before the music even begins shadows form a square frame above Johnny and Pagliacci before Johnny finally choreographs himself to the main stage again of The Street which frames his aquatic dance routine The Noir aspects lend generously to the creation of these proscenium arches shadows this overt and stark are generically not just permitted but required in Film Noir but while the technical justification for these arches may stem from Noir the primary function is to create a performance space for musical numbers to unfold

In the last few months the rents have dived because several occupants have returned home to the Jaffna Peninsula or the eastern districts This internal adjustment in migration should be linked to an assertion by Gunaratna and Rajapakse to the effect that per cent of the Tamils granted asylum in Australia and Canada had indulged in return visits to Sri Lanka It would be simple for the Australian government to check this claim

Tonight was the latest inspirational nudge This started a few months ago when I had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the Bohus Stickning Further stimulation from other knitters on Ravelry led me to read Poems of Color from cover to cover tonight Im already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors Im part Swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more I read about it The fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt I love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item The patterns call for a Rambouillet Angora blend The idea of knitting an adult sweater on size and needles I think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesnt I plan to knit a sample from the book Homespun Handknit called Northern Lights I will test the color choices that I plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater I have some high grade ultra merino and Cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches I feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters It might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber I dont chose for the first I begin to question do I make the whole sweater blended woolangora or just the colorwork The fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft should I make the body out of blended fiber too I guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique One downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater Usually Im a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but I already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true Bohus rather an inspired by Bohus Stickning I dont plan on changing the color chart layout and I intend to keep the look so it will be easily recognizable as what inspired the design For those of you who know the Bohus designs imagine a Purple Shimmer or the Large Lace Collar in multiple hued mostly Purple black and white tones over a white sweater body

More than anything the Oscarwinning success of this brilliant film relaunched the s era private eye genre in a darker mode to suit the unstable s With its rich score by Jerry Goldsmith a wonderfully quotable script by Robert Towne with scalpelprecise direction to match by Roman Polanski this is a work where the lead actors are able to do some of their best ever work the scenes between Jack Nicholson John Huston and especially Faye Dunaway just take your breath away A classic and if you want to read a sustained bit of writing on it you can do no better than finding a copy of Michael Eatons fine BFI Classics monograph on the film for further details click here Nicholson would go on to play JJ Gittes in the very different sequel THE TWO JAKES

The best way to control rodents is to keep them out of the home in the first place Since rodents like to hide in vegetation your first line of defense is to trim the vegetation close to your home Clean yards deny rodents the food and shelter they need for breeding and they restrict a young rodents ability to move in Piles of grass clippings or tree trimmings make ideal rodent harborages so properly store and dispose of these materials Try to leave a couple of feet of clear space between your house and any vegetation Rodents also like to hide under woodpiles or lumber in abandoned cars appliances and furniture and under trashcans So remove and properly dispose of all junk Store any lumber or wood on racks at least inches off the ground and away from the house exterior Store your trash and garbage cans on racks too or else on a concrete pad

Lets start with the ball pens I am very particular with ball pens I dont like gel pens or like sign pens although I use sign pens for special occasions usually for poetry or for notebooks with thick nice paper which are usually cheap imitations of moleskin notebooks As long as they have no lines and the paper is smooth and thick in my mind thats like moleskin even if its really not I like pens that have a smooth feel I dont like pens that feel like they are scratching the paper I like pens that glide smoothly across the page I do not like Gtech pens I have a list of favorite pens that I used to buy in the Philippines They are star pentel faster faber castel and pilot Theres one more ball pen that I like but I forgot what its called Its like cheap My favorite is star pentel but I also like to use pilot ball pens when theres a special occasion Whats a special occasion I dont really have a set of rules I just have a feeling that I want this writing session to be special

Leap then years to todays evangelical approach which is essentially existentialist and youve got a culture that values the individual experience of salvation above all else The quintessential characterization of this culture comes from none other than John Wesley whose strangely warmed heart is the measuring stick The result according to McKnight is that for this culture it is the ability to witness personally to the experience of conversion that matters most Once one has had this experience its all over until the final party arrives

When Rickey realized all that God had saved him from that day in the wrestlingmatch with the deputies and thought about what Shane had been able to share with him he suddenly saw that he had a story to share and a neighborhood full of people who needed to know that God is still in the business of saving people So he got a copy of the police report that described the events of that evening and went around to the homes of people he knew one at a time apologizing telling his own story and telling his friends what Jesus had done for him A lot of the people he was talking to had known him for years and Rickey felt that their reaction was to wait and see on this new change They had seen him go through phases and do crazy things beforewas this just one more But Rickey understood that God was asking him to be faithful with what he had and to continue to share what He had given him Shane estimated that Rickey had shared his story and Jesus story with people Some days he went to the places where he used to buy meth and pot some days he went to neighbors family and friends Some days like the day he went to the store it was up to God to figure out whom he would talk to But every day had now become both a challenge and an adventure

From a historical perspective we might think of these transition events as the visible signals emanating from a slowermoving but also muchhardertoquantify process of political and economic development that includes institutions at the levels of state and society as well as regime Watching for patterns at this temporal and geographic scale is a bit like watching for climate change The mechanisms generating the larger pattern are extremely complex and undoubtedly include elements of endogeneity contagion threshold effects and feedback loops to name just some of the possibilities This kind of causal complexity makes it very hard to isolate the effects of specific variables especially when the data we might use to test those relationships are often scarce or unreliable And yet a pattern emerges The production of greenhouse gases accelerates temperatures rise glaciers retreat and species disappear

Criticisms of PAS have not been limited to mental health professionals as legal scholars have also been loath to accept the premise that parental alienation should be formally classified as a mental illness For example in her article Parental Alienation Syndrome and Alienation Getting it Wrong in Child Custody Cases Carol S Bruch JD voiced concern with Gardners tendency to cite his own nonpeerreviewed books and publications on PAS She noted that in one typical article Gardner cited sources writings of his own and by Sigmund Freud She further refuted Gardners suggestion that PAS was a generally accepted psychiatric phenomenon by pointing out that when the validity of PAS was challenged in court his testimony was often excluded

Symptoms of this antiracism include reverse discrimination such as the enforcement of discriminatory government policies the general media portrayal of blacks as victims and whites as oppressors etc Due to our apartheid past this reverse discrimination has assumed a particularly acute form in South Africa Symptoms include the elimination of the white male from the economy via rampant socalled affirmative action and BEE constant antiwhite propaganda ranging from the blatant to the subtle via the state and private media the suppression of Afrikaans farm murders and other violence land redistribution etc All this carries on while an intolerable culture of extreme political correctness has been established This has been done by a regime which justifies the positive aspects of the above while denying the existence of the negative in the name of a new racist ideology called Transformation

In the end Im not entirely sure what I was supposed to take from The Ballad of Jack and Rose Its such a specific story and the narrow focus makes it difficult for some of the larger themes to translate For example the rebellion of adolescence is a pretty universal concept but as it develops within Roses insular world her form of rebellion can be hard to relate to even for someone who knows some of where shes coming from

This is sort of a bucket list but being such an indefinite time frame makes it a difficult list to compile I have about five things written on the list I suppose its due to the fact that i havent ever aspired to be famous visit great places or meet important people My daughter on the other hand is on her second bucket list She has travelled to over countries visited most of the wonders and tourist sights in the world She has sky dived scuba dived parasailed bungeed surfed you name it just talking about it tires me out At least with my wee little list I certainly dont feel under any pressure to do anything weird and wonderful anytime soon

HENRY JAGLOM Yeah and its very rewarding to me To see A SAFE PLACE getting this DVD release proves all the critics wrong that trashed it when it first came out I mean it got attacked I can remember the New York Times or Time Magazine said the film looked like it had been tossed in the air and landed in a mix master They said it made no sense When really I had a very clear and precise vision for that film I was trying to play with conventional film structure I was playing with daydream and fact illusion and reality and the emotions of past present and future I didnt wanna give it any type of conventional line meaning why follow the tradition of where something begins and ends The film was a failure and people stayed away from it It did get a great notice from Anais Nin however

The first time I saw Paul Gross Men with Brooms it may have been a sanitized TV version though Canadian TV doesnt usually do that because I dont remember it being so scatological in its first halfhour Potty humor aside it remains a fun offbeat sports comedy that treats curling the same way others treat baseball ie as poetry You can pretty much expect that odd Canadian mix of eccentric characters zany humor and truthful wellacted moments I do think it goes overboard in its conclusion which feels like a parody of the Hollywoodian happy ending But fun And the three leads are people that are always watchable Gross himself Leslie Nielson and the soulful Molly Parker The DVD has a short making of featurette and an archive interview with Gross that has nothing to do with the movie

The cat that showed up yet again On Thursday morning she saw D and tore to my door up the flight of steps and into my flat And plonked herself down my side of the bed promptly falling asleep I miss my cats back home sorely if you havent seen my favourite one Ms K yet you should and in Cambridge the rare time I saw a cat wandering about the streets I was on Cloud Nine I used to counsel and process adoptions at the local SPCA back home so being deprived of having animals to touch and cuddle made me feel terrible worse than bad college food that makes you feel sickly and massively unsatisfied at the same time whilst knowing its gonna load you up with fats My main mantra is if I eat loads and grow tubbier thats my business because I chose the food and I loved it but the same effect with food I was forced to pay for and hate No way So there were two blackandwhite cats lurking about college grounds occasionally owned by a resident nearby Everytime I saw either Id be excited and was convinced I would have good luck that day I wished hard enough that Brighton would have loads of cats or that some cat would adopt me and I was far from disappointed This cat dashed towards us as we left the flat for a drink on the first night charging and purring by the light of the full moon Another day when I was walking up the steps to my flat I saw a cat outside my door The main door and my flat door was shut I thought it was a magic cat And let her in D said She tore in when I answered the door and the delivery man came She snooped about everywhere for too long so I let her out but she didnt want to leave the front door Oh

On Wednesday The Hill reported that Barack Obama wouldnt do anything to celebrate the twoyear anniversary of ObamaCare his signature legislative achievement That might have to do with the fact that a majority of voters wants it repealed and even a plurality of Democrats want it rolled back in whole or in part Still just because Obama wants to be a party pooper doesnt mean that others arent celebrating The RNC for instance has this brief spot called ObamaCares Lonely Birthday but which could also be titled Its My Party and Ill Cry If I Want To
At the time it started I was young A few years before Desert Storm had rattled through Iraq showing the full power of the US war machine I marvelled at sights of Fs and Abrams tanks on the television actually in combat I was the kind of kid who grew up playing with tanks so seeing them really working and fighting on the nine oclock news was a bit of a treat When I was a little older the atrocities in Yugoslavia were in full swing I got the idea that there was nothing glorious about this war Here was pictures of refugees villages being bombed citizen armies starvation death and failed strategies by the armies with the big fancy modern machineryThis was brutal and savage But my memories of it are blurred I was becoming a teenager at the time and there were much more important things for me to be concentrating on such as the joys of puberty

Heather Trimlett put out a bead challenge where you choose two colors and make beads only using dots At first I it wouldnt be that hard I love doing dot beads but after the first it got tough My beads are strung onto the leather in the order I completed them starting in the center I started with some of the basics and moved on quickly to masking dot techniques that I had never tried but had seen others do an loved the look As time went on I had to wrack my brain for ideas because it turns out that beads are a lot to do with the same technique being limited to only two colors I used CIM Phoenix and Moretti Dark Red Purple I loved the fact that the Phoenix turned different shades depending on how long it spent in the torch but in the end I think it may have been cheating a bit

However the big moments in the writing only seem to lead up to what Hopper actually revealed in his paintings the moment of dread of longing and quiet coming right after the storm In Hopper there are no big events no big actions You maybe get an aloof stare not out at the viewer but into some unspeakable area of life The only drama in his paintings is two draped feet over a bed harsh morning light angling knifelike in a corner A lit cigarette is like an explosion A cup of coffee a bulwark against time Remember Hopper seems to be saying Be careful with light Thats not salvation it brings

From the expanded multiplayer and exciting new game modes the single player campaign is being kept under tight wraps As a fan and a writer I hope that the anticipation of Halo lives up to what its being hyped up to be I have faith that will take the Halo franchise to new levels and new depths There is a lot of new interesting gameplay ideas that will be incorporated into the series which we have yet to see in videos I dont think gamers should worry about the future of Halo looking back at how much passion and respect has for the Halo franchise This will put ease to many and keep worrying down to a minimum will take Halo to where it hasnt been before I am excited to see where they will take this new trilogy There is no official date set for release although there is speculation that it will be released around November Until then thank you all for reading and feel free to leave a comment and weigh in on the issue

Fair enough I suppose and the paper said that that the Abbey beer resembles the wellknown Belgian Trappist beers which makes it sound really interesting But then the crunch They go on to say that it is of higher quality than the Trappist beers due to being brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot I almost wept Lars however made a very good point that this was a lovely unintentional parody of German attitude to Reinhetsgebot And hes right of course How could you not love this necklikeajockeys attitude that a beer type so beloved of so many people could be improved by application of the Reinheitsgebot

When I said there was nothing new I think that was meant to be part of the idea behind the film The current ghost face is rebooting the original film with a bunh of new kids who mirror the original cast It was possible to have fun with the idea but its falls flat in execution I chalk it up to dividing screen time between the new kids and the old guard There was not enough crossover between their respective plights to merit such a thing It is another reason the old guard should not have appeared The spotlight would have been exclusively on the new kids The audience was bound to be full of dedicated fans They would have gotten the homage to the original film without the old cast there Probably would have been more amusing to boot

CHASUBLE A cloak at first commonly worn by peasants afterwards adopted as an ecclesiastical vestment The first writer that speaks of the casual or chasuble is St Augustine AD He tells a story of a poor tailor at Hippo a little before his own time who lost his chasuble and not having money to buy another went to the Chapel of the Twenty Martyrs at Hippo and prayed that it might be restored to him on which the boys laughed at him for seeming to ask the Martyrs for folles which shows us what was about the price of a chasuble as a largesized fish could be bought for folles De Civ Dei xxii In his own time he speaks of the chasuble as a common article of dress Will you go onhe says with a bad chasuble or a bad boot Then why with a bad soul Serm It was at this time a cloak enveloping the whole person like the manta still worn in Spain with the addition of a hood that might be drawn over the head Being the ordinary dress of the poor it was worn by monks and Bishop Fulgentius about AD strictly ordered that his monks chasubles should not be of a high price or of a bright colour Procopius AD speaks of the chasuble as being a cloak of a slave or of a common person which a general or a private soldier would be ashamed of De Bello Vindal ii Archbishop Caesarius AD left to his successor in his will a longnapped chasuble which he distinguishes from his church robes Pope Gregory I AD presented three pieces of money and a chasuble that is a cloak to a Persian abbot who saluted him in the streets of Rome Boniface III AD sent to King Pepin a chasuble made partly of silk partly of goat s hair with a long nap on which he says that he might wipe his feet dry a very singular use of a chasuble Isidore of Seville AD in his De Originibus describes the chasuble as a garment with a hood and states that its name is a diminutive of casa a house because it covers the whole man like a little house Lib xix St Boniface and a Council held at Ratisbon in order presbyters and deacons not to wear the short military cloak but the chasuble as befitting the servants of God Labbe vi

In short these films are not really such polar opposites of the Swedish film industrys classic Ingmar Bergman template as you might think at first and this is also their key deviation from the template of lefty Scandinavian socialrealist crime fiction even if Larsson and the filmmakers never quite realised it More ties to the classical Swedish tradition for intense portraits of the human experiential crucible are sustained by the presence of the great Per Oscarsson in his last role before his untimely death star of the canonical adaptation of Knut Hamsuns Hunger as Lisbeths former state guardian a compassionate man whos been left partparalysed by a stroke and completely excised from official interest in Lisbeth as opposed to the attentive Blomkvist His presence and the way it is utilised elucidates an interesting idea that the welfare state is only good for your welfare when guided by principles and people of decency and it can be turned into another apparatus of controlled social narcotisation Played With Fire trots in far fewer cornball bestseller cues than its predecessor although plenty still slip by with a new minor hero whos a mixed martial arts enthusiast an archvillain whos a former KGB agent and a hulking offsider whos one of the most striking monstrous goons since Jaws in the s Bond movies The series basic conceit of trying to conflate state and corporate paternalist behaviour with a more intimate personally violent version of the same thing is both calculatedly paranoid and more than a little reductive and yet its also coherently conceived and executed at least insofar as Larssons tales offer up characters who constantly conveniently illustrate the matters at hand abusive officials of state medicine and law enforcement whose conspiracies hamper justice and victimise societys

The weeks leading up to this trip I was really getting excited and ready to go but deep down inside the devil was working on me I think I had this feeling that I was going to get there and not want to be Was I wrong Finally getting to Kombolcha after hours of plane travel one day and hours riding in a sardine can the next I was starting to feel that this was going to be AWESOME When we pulled up to the care point and there were kids there to greet us as we got out of the vans like we were famous was a really good feeling I shook so many hands and still hadnt got in the gate Once in the gate I heard clapping as I walked down this path in the trees It started out a faint sound but as I got closer the volume got louder As I walked into the church which was a cleaned out chicken house the noise was incredible So many hands clapping and kids smiling at me was a little overwhelming I stood in front of these kids and just took it all in WOW As I stood there I was scanning them looking for the girl Deanna and I sponsor I couldnt find her though After we got introduced to them we went out to hug and meet them I shook their hands fist bumped and hugged so many of them as I could Greg and I started a huge rock paper scissors game Im not sure who was winning because there were so many playing The ladies in our group were taking pictures and hugging as well Thank goodness for digital cameras because the kids love to see themselves in the pictures after you take them During this time Im pretty sure Sandy hugged and kissed every single one of these kids IMAGINE THAT Here was another warm fuzzy moment for me Getting to interact with them was a blast I was still looking for my sponsored girl and couldnt find her I felt down a little bit cause I couldnt Where was this face on my refrigerator

Its all about the hockey and thats partly because hockey is about stories I remember one particular game a very special one where my team the Boston Bruins lost Doesnt sound like a good story for me right But then the next day I discovered that the opponents had dedicated that game to their assistant coach Luke Richardson and his family who had lost his year old daughter Daron to suicide earlier that day It is this kind of story that makes the winning less important than the heart of the players and the team and this is one of several reasons that this particular team is my second favourite hockey team these days It is also another reason I love the sport so much
It was a good full amazing year And there is no doubt in my mind that this year will be quite similar and I need not worry about not accomplishing enough

The particular history of the use of eminent domain in Georgia for economic development or redevelopment starts in a Georgia Supreme Court decision from the early s which barred the use of condemnation to take slum property for the construction of public housing Georgias Constitution was amended by the legislature and voters in the next general election to allow the use of eminent domain for abatement of blight a term used to describe substandard housing that would be the subject for slum clearance This was a key legal innovation that cleared the way for Urban Renewal projects that were presented as progressive reforms but which were later jocularly but accurately called Negro Removal projects

Being a mom is difficult I imagined myself as a mom and it definitely is tiring First of all the pregnancy And then educating the kids to become a wellbehaved human And then teaching the kids how to fit in the society well And then ensuring that the kids do not make friends with wrong people And then making the kids excel at everything because you just want to see that kid on top of everyone else See Its not easy Its one painfully hard task I think every single mom deserve an award

I think it is time we start talking about the elephant that is in the room Many churches in America are dead Oh we have nice buildings and sing songs but lets not kid ourselves we are dead Our churches are filled with people who are more concerned about their own comforts than the souls of lost people We are more concerned that we get our way rather than asking the question what is Gods way Our board meetings are filled with a spirit but it is neither holy nor convicting Many times we ask those who are newest in the church to change so as not to unsettle those who have been in the church the longest We become more concerned by what is played musically rather than if worship is taking place at all Oh I could go on but the truth is the truth and it is time for us to act upon it The church is dying because we have allowed Satan to take refuge in our churches

You do NOT love dresses as you cant crawl in them You try and try to do this goofy onekneed gorilla scoot thing but you get tripped up and dont know what to do I usually bring a change of clothes and put you in something that actually allows movement after everyone has had a chance to coo over your cuteness Its kind of a shame because you have a lot of darling summer dresses but well wait on putting them on you until you can walk Why are girls clothes so impractical

The only treatment my GP could offer was the psychological treatment at the local ME clinic When I asked for prescriptions for some of the supplements that are recommended I was refused How can GPs facilitate personalised plans when their knowledge is based on NICE guidelines or psychological material There cannot be any patient choice until the medical profession and social care accept that it is a neurological condition Fragmented and inadequate NHS services will remain as there is no real commitment by some Susan Rogers Beckenham Kent sick for years
Yes HALF SLAVE HALF FREE SOLOMON NORTHUPS ODYSSEY had a few flaws that include the occasional slow pacing and hammy acting from a few members of the cast including the leading man But the movie is a well made and fascinating look into the experiences of a free man who found himself trapped into the institution of th century slavery Director Gordon Parks and star Avery Brooks proved to be the driving force in a firstrate movie that was at times entertaining horrifying educational and especially poignant SOLOMON NORTHUPS ODYSSEY might prove to be hard to find I would recommend Netflix or Amazon But in the end the movie is worth the search I assure you

It is common practise nowadays for people to speedread through lengthy articles The mind usually absorbs words in the first sentence of a paragraph and thats it This annoying modernday trend has created the erroneous worldwide perception that the Afrikaans language and by implication the AfrikanerBoer are to blame for the Soweto uprisings Its just another one of the many psyoptricks that have been utilized over the years to destroy another perfectly healthy and productive Christian minority group who were a thorn in the flesh for satan and his cronies But lets leave spirituality religion and dark politics out of this for now and stick to the facts
I started back on my eating program yesterday Its an important step for me because in the past I lose weight and then lose my way The fact that i made it thru yesterday after taking days off is great Im proud of myself because the voice that tells me You cant stick to this didnt win Just a day by day approach but anytime I can fall apart get up and try again is a big victory to me Interestingly without having food to buffer my thoughts and feelings I have noticed the chatter has been a little more fierce and I dont really feel psychically that great Cutting out the sugar is part of it it has a nasty detox It isnt about getting thin Thin most times makes people look older or sick I am tired of feeling powerless over what I put in my mouth and the sneaksecret eating makes me feel like I have a layer of grime on me When you are out of balance and out of control and your drug is something you do in hiding is different that food being your drug because when you are fat you have no choice in showing the world there is something out of balance My powerlessness over food shows every time I move and my man jiggle underneath the unforgiving fabric of my shirt With drugs you can simply not be around them with food we still have to eat Im inviting the program of NA into my food thing Thankfully I dont have to know how to stay on an eating plan long term I only have to care for myself with my food choices in this moment and then in this day I remember an episode of Designing Women where Suzanne talks about the irony of her spending a day hurt and sad because she had too much to eat when there was a boy representing a foreign country there trying to educate the world on the starvation of his family and others in his crippled home land

What I did not mention in this story is the larger issue of theft Effectively there was none for the same reasons the renter of the car was unconcerned about details of who I was If everyone knows everyone in a small island stealing will be difficult to accomplish without getting caught If I steal your TV how will I keep it a secret without living a cloistered life Word travels like wildfire and learn of the theft immediately all eyes will be on the lookout and invariably someone will learn of its new home

If you passed somebody in the street who was smiling slightly maniacally handing out spiritual books with great enthusiasm and telling people how wonderful the world is once you accept the love of the almighty Krntqz Im guessing youd move on swiftly and try not to make eye contact This is not a worldview youre familiar with it clashes with your own and this persons behaviour looks far more like that of a certifiable lunatic than a true prophet People in cultures far different from our own have undoubtedly had identical reactions to a similar scenario in which the word Krntqz is merely replaced with Jesus Would you have earned Krntqzs anger if he turns out to be the one true god any less than they should incur the wrath of Yahweh

He went to get his ticket It was a more complicated affair than it had to be owing to the whims and peculiarities of how Jim Crow played out in a particular town or establishment For a time there was a single ticket agent working both boothsthe window for the colored and the one for the white The agent swiveled between the two openings to sell the movie tickets a roll to the white line and then a pivot to the colored It created unnecessary confusion and waiting time for one line or the other the waiting borne more likely by the colored moviegoers than the white as waiting to be served after colored people would have been unacceptable to the white clientele By the time Pershing was nearly grown the swiveling ticket agent was dispensed with in favor of altogether separate windows and ticket sellers which would cost a little more but would move the white and colored lines along more quickly and more in keeping with the usual protocols of Jim Crow

One point I see is that there will be no more Big Salaries going to the top players of the sport This will have an impact on what then individuals give their attention to in their life where there would no more be a money incentive to pursue sports as a child to dedicate oneself to a particular sport in consideration that this particular sport just also happens to come with a big pay cheque You often here the players talk about their Love for the Game I wonder if this statement would hold true if there was no money involved Also one must look at how These Big Salaries influence and shape societyculture from the perspective of how a childs parents would push and encourage their child to become good a sports Obviously this would not be if there was not the possibility to become really rich Thus These Big Salaries catch and hold the attention of parents and children alike and thus act as an invisible guiding hand within the likes and dislikes of the individual shaping the overall attitude and expression of a particular culture and society

History is written by the winners glib but true The cliche comes from the kernel of truth in a phrase Apart from some of course Theres never fire with smoke People love making smoke Some are even professionals at making smoke that looks like fire to back up their original smoke Wait for the fire I say And while you wait consider the goat Theres no smoke with goats no blustering about If pressed you will notice there isnt any fire either Goats have dodged the idiom with agility and grace And therein their talent The losers didnt make it and only a handful of winners did cowering in advisory roles so that they may scribble their account of History Where are all the survivors then They are outside my tent right now chewing a handkerchief They are a little way down the road eating and sleeping in cement They are headbutting a greedy pigeon just because it deserved it They are those who learned how to dodge the conflict in its entirety pronking past all skirmishes to a life of mediocrity They are goats

I recently had a client suggest that I write a blog post about Facebook It was a reasonable suggestion given that it so frequently comes up with my clients I spent some time mulling over what I wanted to say I thought about how some people share things on Facebook that theyd never share so openly in similar facetoface situations I mean would you really get up in front of or or friends and say some of the things youve said on Facebook

TV vegetable is just a light hearted alternative or slightly irrelevant look at some of the TV Ive been consuming over the past week It probably reviews bits and pieces from a few shows likely some high quality HBO drama or something similar and possibly some I dont watch too much TV so dont expect it to cover everything and Ive no wish to be a tv reporter from the living room trenches so dont expect it to be too in depth either Although it might on the odd occasion

The Sunday TimesLondon June reported that Rear Admiral Chris Parry one of Britains most senior military strategists has warned that western civilisation faces a threat on a par with the barbarian invasions that destroyed the Roman empire He said future migrations would be comparable to the Goths and Vandals while north African Barbary pirates could be attacking yachts and beaches in the Mediterranean within years Europe including Britain could be undermined by large immigrant groups with little allegiance to their host countriesa reverse colonisation as Parry described it These groups would stay connected to their homelands by the internet and cheap flight Globalisation makes assimilation seem redundant and oldfashioned the process acts as a sort of reverse colonisation where groups of people are selfcontained going back and forth between their countries exploiting sophisticated networks and using instant communication on phones and the internet

And finally this is a community idea We stand even now as those who have already inherited the kingdom of light We already share in that blessing and we stand together We are strengthened We are qualified We share in the kingdom Maybe it would be a good idea for the church for the saints to celebrate the community aspect of our faith more often I dont mean in a superficial and merely Sunday morning kind of way but an always everyday praying encouraging suffering kind of way The practice of Christian faith must come alive and stop being stagnant We share in the Kingdom of Light The Kingdom of light is visible not only to the world around us but also to one another

As Trixie proceeds to humiliate the characters in Ponyville its clear that the necessary response to Trixie is to whip out proper magic and put her in her place its established consistently that Trixies magic is nowhere as powerful as Twilights Instead Twilight backs away in discouragement The problem with secularism is that even as it separates the religious life from the communal life it forces the religious person to experience a shared identity with the dark side of religiosity Outwardly lived the contrasts are open to exposure criticism and analysis Inwardly lived we may disagree but we fail to confront those problems where they fester instead of heal

Karla was never confident like her older sister Beth Karla was awkward Shy She felt out of place Of the two Beth was clearly the leader And yet for years it was Karla we all followed Every hairraising step of her inadvertent journey through bipolar disorder and addiction carried her and us along with her like a balloon on the wind rudderless from whim to whim leaving collateral damage in her wake And yet with all the damage the seeming disarray there was always always a gift Courage found at the last minute when it was needed most Resourcefulness against all odds Steadfastness And the journeys we took through the years The stories The adventures The fury the frustration They call to mind Romans But we also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance from perseverance character and from character hope And hope does not disappoint

The weeks certainly do roll past quickly Last evening I was working on a project that I had put off conquering That left my mind in a completely different direction There is not enough of it left to spread in more than one place So I quickly chose two recipes and a thought flashed through my extended mind which I quickly grasped and calmly went to bed thinking that I had everything under control I awakened in the wee hours this morning with my subconscious nudging me that I still had this job to do I was tempted to just pull the covers up tightly and pretend that I had a free day That did not happen and I also could not recall what I had decided to focus on this week That was scary enough to really wake me up As I pondered deeply and discarded a few substituted ideas my original idea floated past So I scrambled only to me it was a scramble to those of you who already have your day well on its way it was more like slow motion out of bed and here I am much earlier than I ever planned before my thoughts vanish again

When you have absorbed as much sensory information as you can you are ready to write the scene Resist the urge to string together adjectives too many can diminish the power of your description and resist the urge to use everything you learned It is better to pick one or two exceptional details that give an impression of the whole rather than attempting to describe the entire scene Most readers today do not want to sit through long descriptions They want to get a quick sense of the place and then move on to the action

And then theres Polanski The director ensures a dialogue heavy and complicated script holds together without an ounce of fat He apparently eliminated a Gittes voiceover from the script and tightened up the famous ending bringing everything to a head in one climactic confrontation instead of over several more complex scenes He also placed the films celebrated Forget it Jake its Chinatown at the very end The line had apparently already existed elsewhere in the script but Towne could never quite make it fit in the end its placement is perfect capturing the tragic futility Gittes struggle in a single phrase

There is however a reasoning from conservatism that can be made in favour of same marriage but the Conservative Party is not pursuing it and neither Daniel Finkelstein nor Tim Montgomerie are making it The reasoning is simply this if years and decades or generations after the introduction of civil partnership it were observed that the people are routinely referring to such couples as being married and if years and decades or generations later it were observed that society has shifted and custom adapted then the conservative would in pursuit of national harmony acknowledging a new beautiful order simply recognise this fact There would be no engineered social change no revolution in the state and no imposition of a new definition The change would have been incremental barely perceptible and the conservative would accept the new social arrangement

To be clear abortion when a fetus reaches viability is murder not manslaughter All involved to make that happen are conspiring to commit murder That means the patient doctors people who review tests and procedures their clinic and its leaders get where this is going The only way this could ever drop to manslaughter is via ambivalent evidence which means that all involved did NOT get enough evidence to prove the fetus was NOT viable If States can start turning this into manslaughter on principled grounds then more power to them The longstanding traditions of quickening being the first sign of life and birth being a major event however cuts both ways which is why we have viability language in the SCOTUS decision

Remember that announcement of an HD port of Jet Set Radio posted some time ago Im not saying its dead but after reading this you might be a bit concerned Citing financial difficulties in the last fiscal year which ended last Saturday Sega has layoff many workers from both its US and European branches and downsizing the company to maintain sustainable profitability In light of this Sega also mentioned that for these markets theyll now focus more on games that are surefire his for them including Sonic Total War Aliens and Football Manager This puts other projects in danger of cancellation or being left to fend for themselves which include Virtua Fighter Final Showdown Anarchy Reigns Yakuza and the aforementioned Jet Set Radio HD port While Sega did mention that they have cancelled games all of them so far are unspecified ie never shown to the public But still this puts much concern on which projects Sega will give us now as they too are yet another victim of believing Westerners like their guns and football save for Sonic And the sad thing about all this What they believe is right

And then there is the childless couple who wants children banned Maybe Im wrong but Im pretty sure they were both babies at some point in their lives And when they were babies Id bet money on the fact that they cried on occasion And if we asked their mothers Im sure we would find out that some of those fits of crying were in public GASP Children are going to cry They are going to get upset Sometimes even though a fit in a public place like a restaurant or airplane but I dont think the solution is banning them from entering those spaces The solution is better parenting and teaching our children how to behave in those spaces and places If we cant take our children out then how will they ever learn how to behave in public You can role play with them read them books on the topic and tell them until you are blue in the face but until they are sitting strapped into a booster seat in a restaurant with white table clothes they really wont get it Its the experiences our children have that really mold them and their behavior When Paige acts up in a restaurant we tell her to stop If she doesnt listen we take her outside for a time out A few weeks ago Daniel brought her outside at least times during one meal And it was frustrating But the next time went a lot smoother And Im sure each time we go she will behave better and better If we had been banned from entering a restaurant Paige never would have had the experience of learning to control herself in that space

The film proper ends with a haunting stark shot of the porter slumped over in the restroom totally broken and resigned to his fate Murnau and Mayer wanted to end the film with the protagonists sad death completing their theme of a man crushed by his societys limiting ideas of a mans worth The studio wanted a happier resolution though and Murnau and Mayer technically fulfill that mandate with a cynical absurd epilogue thats practically dripping with sarcasm Its even preceded by a title that explicitly identifies this ending as a deus ex machina an intervention of the filmmakers with no relation to reality In this ending the porter is saved from his fate by an unlikely inheritance from a wealthy stranger and he celebrates his good luck lavishly while doling out gifts to other unfortunate souls The whole thing plays out as a ridiculous fantasy where its entirely obvious that the director and writer have nothing but contempt for this addition to their art and this tone winds up undermining the happy ending that the producers had wanted In its very unreality this epilogue simply reinforces the theme since only an openly unrealistic miracle can save this sad man from what otherwise seemed an unavoidable and dismal fate

You must do some very careful research when examining this digital camera from the spec information from the manufacturer to peoples reviews on popular online retailers Make sure you read carefully and have a good idea of what type of product you would like to purchase You still will not know until you use the digital camera yourself if it will fulfill your requirements On paper this may seem like the best camera for using outside and underwater But some of the reviewers say they werent too pleased with the reality of the digital camera The photos and videos are great for an outdoor digital camera that is merely a small point and shoot digital camera But it lacks a few features that would make it the perfect outdoor digital camera

The acting is hard to get a read on Cneyt Arkin as the inspector is really the only character you will get to know all that well The man must have been doing something right as he has acting credits and Ive read that he was actually in over films He certainly has a unique and cool Amitabh style about him Im almost certain he must have been as successful as he was due to his looks and suave demeanor but thats OK I was eating up a little myself Despite some obvious undercranking for some ridiculously paced fights hes pretty agile for a guy who would have been near when this was filmed Seeing him bounce on trampolines with silly looking spray painted swords is worth the price of admission

As I touched upon earlier people often associate PTSD with wildly unpredictable and violent behavior But in reality this is not the case While its true that anger and irritability are two symptoms associated with PTSD this doesnt mean a person with this disorder is an emotional ticking time bomb I believe whats often left out of discussions about PTSD and potential violent behavior is a persons inborn traits As you all know some people have personality traits that make them more confrontational or aggressive than others So PTSD or any major stress factor may make a naturally aggressive person more susceptible to lashing out in anger than a less aggressive person But I believe this is the case only if the naturally aggressive person has poor impulse control to begin with I feel its unrealistic and unfair to believe that simply because someone has PTSD they are automatically more violent than the average person

I have participated in my fair share of therapy You might have guessed that if you have been reading my blog for very long I hope you have And as a result of all of that therapy I tend to over analyze my own thinking feelings and have lengthy conversations with the third party voice in my head I was once told that this is a symptom of codependence and maybe it is Either way the voice I am willing to concede is my own voice doubting and judging myself Because of this doubting judge I always second guess my feelings of being taken advantage of or perhaps being used Those are kind of harsh words for what I mean but you get the gist I tend to be over generous something I have also been told is a symptom of codependence always trying to be nice please and gain favor by others and to keep the peace etc Maybe all true either way again it is who I am and while I am aware of the therapeutic analogies that go along with the behaviors I cannot for the life of me stop myself from getting into situations where I have been kind and generous to a personThen feeling after a period of time that I have fallen prey to someone who is wholly capable to taking advantage of the situation and thereby rendering me PISSEDat them and myself

Our nation has been successively wrecked its people incrementally altered and any and all opposition be it from the right or indeed the left utterly thwarted when I say the left there are those that may throw up their hands in horror or indeed wonder at my thinking however for any student of politics it comes as no shock at all to realise that the left and what masqueraded as it in the last government are completely differing entities although extreme Marxism had a hand in the former government finance had the greater the primary section of the mainstream left changed utterly adopting facets of right of centre thinking economically and internationally indeed the shift of the paradigm within the body of the left is not defined simply here at home but occurs with coideologists globally one need only look to communist China or Cuba for example quite simply the fringe left and indeed the fringe right have been left behind as a new political order came into being and the political narrative globally changed perhaps forever The fringe left within this country were never happy with NuLabour never happy at all and indeed like the right acrimony and intergroup conflict both within the mainstream upon the periphery were and are notable Today there are those within the leftist camp that will not shed a tear at the demise of NuLabour as indeed there are upon the right

This state of ambiguity is so repulsive to the institutional church When I was at my wits end and in the last gasps of living in a naive state that had me suckered into believing that a community of institutional christians would actually WANT to remove itself out of the futileness of a church system I concluded that the overall corporate sense of ambiguity that began to emerge in the church I attended was actually the best thing that could possibly happen to me The church was getting large and was heading into a state of vagueness which for me was my wakeup call

The films of Hollis Frampton can be boring fascinating and hilarious and somehow all of these at the same time The artist began his creative career in painting and photography but in the early s he realized that sequencing and timing were essential to what he was trying to achieve He couldnt force a viewer to go back to photo number and look at it for eight seconds Thus a career in avantgarde cinema was born the scope of which is expertly condensed in a twodisc set from Criterion A Hollis Frampton Odyssey

I love the dead kids but just as entertaining are Octobers live friends Stacey a boy with a Walkman and Yumi In one scene Stacey tells off a popular girlbully in such a fitting way that I cheered out loud reading it The standout however in terms of secondary characters is Octobers father With a book so filled with wisecracks and pop culture references I expected to be entertained but I didnt expect to be touched Yet the subplot about October and her clinically depressed father is heartwarming His awkward attempts to connect with his daughter and Octobers desire to learn more about her mother make you want to just hug them both Take this passage

Mr Cunningham is an example of a curious cultural phenomenon His fervor and unbreakable dedication to his work is not simply trapped in the world of fashion In every walk of life there are maniacs of a similar sort people who have crafted something seemingly minor into an art form Look at plumbing I guarantee there are people who care so deeply about controlling the path of water in an industrial environment that they have made it their life work Every aspect of our society has an obsessive unrelenting and unyielding whittling their field down from the basic to the infinitely artful For Cunningham its what people wear For Isaac Newton it was calculus For Bill Gates its computing They are the web of passion coursing through every fiber of civilization holding the whole thing together for the rest of us The blood pumping away under the surface

Why am I on the Vicodin you ask Because I while getting up from the floor whilst cleaning my cabinets picked up my lber aka Mac on Sunday morning and did something fierce to my back I honestly thought the pain from the last month of pregnancy was enough to break me but that was nothing compared to this pain How I have managed to work through this is beyond me but I am a warrior I can barely walk when I first get up and then while walking I get lovely spasms that take my breath away I went to my chiropractor yesterday and he believes I have a bulging disc He adjusted me and then they proceeded to give me antiinflammatory injections and then a massage Nothing changed Last night I took matters into my own hands and broke out the leftover V that I had from my csection I tell you that helped a lot But I also think it just helped that I wasnt sitting nonstop as I have to do at work Today I woke up not feeling much better Came into work for a bit and then went back to the Chiro I was basically hoping he would magically fix me but alas Im still in lots of pain I do feel about better but who knows if thats the pain pills or if the problem is starting to dissipate I just need to be better by Friday when we leave at am to fly out to San Francisco Mamas got a lot of walking plans on Friday Saturday and Sunday and let me tell you picking up the kiddo and walking around dont sound too appealing to me right now So please pray to the back healing gods that I start to feel better soon I would appreciate any positive back healing vibes sent my way

Amit Goswami The current worldview has it that everything is made of matter and everything can be reduced to the elementary particles of matter the basic constituentsbuilding blocksof matter And cause arises from the interactions of these basic building blocks or elementary particles elementary particles make atoms atoms make molecules molecules make cells and cells make brain But all the way the ultimate cause is always the interactions between the elementary particles This is the beliefall cause moves from the elementary particles This is what we call upward causation So in this view what human beingsyou and Ithink of as our free will does not really exist It is only an epiphenomenon or secondary phenomenon secondary to the causal power of matter And any causal power that we seem to be able to exert on matter is just an illusion This is the current paradigm

Given that the Tories whole strategy was based on the lunatic idea that by cutting Public Spending the money would somehow miraculously find its way into investment by the private sector who would create jobs and growth this is bad news That is especially true as the secondary element of that strategy was that growth would come from the biggest increase in exports the UK has ever known at a time when manufacturing exports are also suffering as similarly minded rightwing populists in Europe set about cratering the EU economy via a similar set of austerity measures when the governments of booming Asian economies have tightened the screws to prevent the opposite danger of inflation and the US recovery is also faltering with the danger of it suffering a liquidity trap in which the Federal Reserve has ballooned its Balance Sheet by printing money and buying Bonds but the economy is still failing to respond leaving it with few monetary levers left to pull

Archibalds dream meant a great deal of travel in exploration and surveying and a great deal of frustration at the slow pace of Chinese life But alongside the Littles interest in and huge sympathy for the Chinese people whom they saw as being the victims of an inert and corrupt government in which all decisions were taken on the basis of a thousandyearold tradition irrelevant to the nineteenth century was horror at the effects of the customary footbinding which crippled women in pursuit of the ideal of tiny feet Archibald had already noted that its effect was to force women to kneel to carry out agricultural labour because they could not stand and women who could barely walk were often forced to haul junks and barges

The religious world is greatly fragmented and becoming more so as the days pass Many will say that they have received a revelation They may have a new idea about Gods Word Some churches encourage the gift of prophecy and prophets are coming out of the proverbial woodwork A new cult is born A new church is founded A new doctrine is spawned
The Bhootnatha Temples are dedicated to Lord ShivaShiva in the form of the God of souls spirits and ghosts Built out of red sandstone probably sourced from the surrounding hills the two temples are placed opposite one another at the eastern and western banks of the Agastya Teertha The approach to the Agastya Teertha and the Bhootnatha Temples from Badami Caves is via a narrow and winding path that passes through a village

Amidst this maelstrom of desperation and decay one that emits a sort of oddly appealing energy Shteyngart has created an utterly realistic love story that evokes the doomed relationship between Winston Smith and Julia in Orwells While spending a year in Rome recruiting High Net Worth Individuals for a program of Indefinite Life Extension Lenny Abramov a rumpled overweight yearold and the son of Russian immigrants meets Eunice Park years his junior and herself the daughter of Korean immigrants After Lenny returns to New York Eunice for reasons she cant fully understand follows him and the novel traces their unlikely relationship as it plays out against the citys increasingly grim landscape Perhaps nothing symbolizes the cultural and emotional gulf separating the pair than their relationship to books or media artifacts disdained by Eunices contemporaries for their moldy smell Lenny sprays his copy of WAR AND PEACE with PineSol People just arent meant to read anymore Eunice tells him as he tries to engage her in a Milan Kundera novel Were in a postliterate age You know a visual age

Now for the rewards Before this they got to watch TV and play on the computer when they wanted within reason The problem was I had to subjectively judge their behaviour and decide weather they deserved to get to do these things or not and when Now they were beyond excited to be able to use the tickets to do the very same activities they were doing before The difference is that Accountable Kids system regulates that the chores are done before the ticket is available for the activity And one activity can be done per ticket I didnt have to run the risk of being unfair or have to play fun police all the time That was wearing me pretty thin They were now regulating themselves Of course thats not to say that you can just put a bunch of cards on the peg and walk away expecting your household to run smoothly But having the construct of the peg board and responsibility cards helps me be more consistent with checking what theyve done I cant decide to be a stickler for rules one day and let them run amok the next So it helps me and it helps them

Some people thought enough is enough and created a sort of public commitment declaration to boycott Elsevier including not publishing peerreviewing or joining Editorial Boards of Journals own by Elsevier In principle it seems like a good idea Let alone the moral stand Our university is facing cuts in research budget for seminars travelling even teaching every year for the last three Giving money to a company whose only effort is some secretary work printing books and running a website making over of benefit a year seems wrong Especially if we take in account that there are lots of academics behind funded by public bodies and usually Governments doing most of the work for free Whats more paying for it since these universities and research centres are the ones which pay for the journals

For starters the crime under the microscope here is not murder and it is rare and refreshing for a crime novelist to look at some of the other crimes if betrayal can even be classified as a fullbodied crime certainly most European countries have decriminalised adultery That doesnt mean this book is without any felony there are several including assault invasion of privacy defamation illegal entry but the word crime itself only appears three times and even there its talking about how betrayal is not a crime Betrayal was nominated for the Glass Key Award for the best Nordic crime novel in and has since become a bestseller across Europe but what this book does to good effect is use the format of the crime novel to attempt to dissect the nature of betrayal The Collector would not be considered a crime novel but it most certainly is and if this book were marketed differently it could slip onto the contemporary fiction shelves and hold its own but I doubt it would have been read by a fraction of the people who have read it otherwise

Its interesting by contrast to consider the historical conditions that surrounded the evolution of the concept of hope in the ethical thought of the Western world Like so much of postclassical Western culture it emerged out of the creative collision between Greek philosophy and Christian religious ideas in the late Roman world That was not an age of economic expansion and rising standards of living Quite the contrary as the Roman Empire ran up against its own limits to growth and then drove itself into bankruptcy and collapse trying to defend borders defined in a more expansive age economic crises and a soaring tax burden sent standards of living steadily downwards while the Empire lasted Its fall in turn brought an age of chaos in which whole regions that had once known widespread literacy busy market economies and such amenities as central heating devolved into fragmented impoverished and drastically underpopulated successor states in which eking out a bare subsistence was an achievement not everyone managed

Now I havent watched more than a handful of episodes of How I Met Your Mother because I dont have cable and CBS doesnt play nice with Hulu but what I have seen left me with a positive impression of Cobie Smulders Still the decision just kind of came from out of nowhere for me and while it neither increased nor decreased my excitement for the movie I was kinda curious to see if Joss Whedon and Co had included her because they planned on using Maria Hill as a bit of comic relief or as the straight man for someone else or if Smulders had the acting chops to play hard and serious on the bridge of the Helicarrier

The first patrol car arrived right away followed by two more one man cars We began giving information to Patrolman Artie DAmbrosia Detective Michael Carney a friend rolled up alone in his car then others arrived As I showed them where the shooter had stood we spotted four caliber shell casing on the ground and I knew that what I thought had been a revolver in the the shooters hand was instead a semiautomatic pistol which ejects its spent casings I was kicking myself for telling the dispatcher that I thought I had seen a revolver

At this point I stopped myself and tried to make a Uturn OK but what about all the good things you did today When you got home you sat on the kitchen floor with Rowan on your lap while he ate his bowl full of figs You read stories and crawled around like a panda You hugged and kissed and tickled and laughed Played the toasting game at dinner Had a mini dance party in the living room You gave him a bath and sang songs Marveled at how much he understands and how much you understand the way he communicates his understanding You just spent the last hour settling him down for sleep And right now he is so cozy asleep in your arms

A few staples that I always include in my garden even though they dont grow the best are as follows Spinach Romaine Lettuce Squash several types Cucumbers Tomatoes Potatoes Onions Garlic and at least one type of Carrot Sometimes about every third or fourth year I will grow corn but corn depletes the nutrients in soil to an extreme degree and its not really possible to grow it consistently in my area
I was looking around for some stuff to read and I came across a blog offering fledgling novelists writing advice I thought great I could use some of that So I went to the blog and saw the most horribly written article Ive ever seen No thats not true but given that this is a blog dedicated to offering writing advice to writers the irony hit me in the stomach like a boyfriend trying to rid the world of an illegitimate child Gross Anyway I saw this terrible blog and I thought hey I can really help this dude

The breast exam video played without controversy During the male genital asessment video though there was a bit of an uproar The patient in the video was uncircumcised and the narrator explained that with such patients the examiner asks them to retract their foreskin The guy in the video did and youd think there was mouse in there or something Gasps and actual muffled screams from the ladies in the audience I didnt hear any of the five other guys but maybe they freaked too Im not sure exactly why they were so surprised andor horrified Once he pulled it back it looked like a circumsized something I assume theyd seen before Maybe they were shocked by the amount of foreskin Cause he did have a lot Whatever the reason it cracked me up to see and hear such an extreme reaction
I think its about capturing something fundamental in the fewest possible words It doesnt matter if its only a couple of hundred words if they are the right ones then you can talk about all the big issues life death love hate loneliness and of course cake just as easily as you can in a couple of hundred thousand And I think because a flash asks a lot of the reader asks them to bring their own knowledge and to do a lot of work to decode meaning then the impact of the story can be much greater Its like distillation A novel is a few pints of lager and a short story is a bottle of good wine But flashfiction is a measure of year old single malt All you need is a sip to be able to get the full complexity of the flavours

The large problem I have with the magazine is purely down to it being Official Reviews are always going to be slightly suspect and a majority of the magazine reads like a PR press release dissected into a less formal tone the magazine never feels like it is speaking from its own perspective The previews give an impression that each game is going to be amazing and the reviews really seem to be safely following the crowd no controversial scores here

Im afraid that P took this rather personally at first The poor guy had throat surgery several years ago and as a result has a shortened soft palate and no uvula He does sometimes make quiet involuntary sounds when he eats certain things and hes rather selfconscious about it He was a bit insulted that at every single meal his son would turn away from him cover the ear closest to him and make angry sounds to cover up his chewing They had many conversations about it but nothing was ever resolved P explained that it was hurtful and that he found it disrespectful C explained that it wasnt personal and he couldnt help it and neither side was happy not to mention the stress this put on me as the person who loved them both and knew they both loved each other and who was attempting to mediate this whole thingnot to make it all about me but it IS my blog you know

So even if Cavern of Souls turns out to be the bringer of doom for countermagic in Standard which I highly highly doubt its a good thing when everything comes around The resulting format might turn out to be worse than the one we previously had but that is okay Since there are constantly new sets coming out and rotations every year Standard has the beautiful ability to heal itself in that way The important part is that we as players constantly get new challenges in terms of cards decks and meta games
This time is definitely more about my husband and his side of the family However she now knows just how I always felt about her From the moment we first met she was willing to talk to me and share Maybe I was just really willing to listen She took the pressure of joining a family and made me feel like I just might belong I dont have much to remember her by except for a few pictures and the conversations that were had I do have two items that she gave me and they have always been front and center in our home One sits at our desktop and the other I used to wear daily on my right hand until I found it to be too fragile for every day wear
Thats why its a good idea any chance you get to run to any show that pairs Glass and with groundbreaking theater director Robert Wilson Even just a whiff of Wilson it turns out goes a long way For a recent evening at the Baryshnikov Arts Center entitled On the Beach which ran for three nights April Wilson presented the results of an experimental threeweek session at his Watermill Arts Center this spring that brought about a dozen farflung visual and performing artists to riff on scenes from on the GlassWilson avantopera odyssey Einstein on the Beach Creating teams of designersdirectors from his curated pool Wilsons only other major input to the show was to deliver lighting notes to the artists and to organize the performers who appeared with Jared Mezzochis stunning videos during the transition scenes Still Wilsons unique theatrical sense highcaliber technical execution with a lowkey tone permeated most of the night This was indeed fun stuff

She was having a bad day at school so I thought Id cheer her up by making this for her when she got home It started off ok until my friend who was here refinishing my wood floors distracted me and I accidentally browned the bacon and onions too much Instead of scrapping it I continued with the process then made him taste it for me I cook by smell and sight when cooking with seafood and it smelled ok so I think he was safe He said it was actually really good and liked the flavor the overcooked bacon and onions gave it so thats how my regular clam chowder became caramelized bacon and onion clam chowder that and as you can tell from the picture its on the tan side vs white I also had my inlaws test it out too and it got a good from my father inlaw which in his language means you

Peace such a tough topic given the state of the world today So many nations across the world are at war with one another or sometimes with others within the nation and so many people are at war with one another or sometimes at war with themselves As individuals and nations people are crying out for peace and yet war rages War between two people is really just about a lack of love When two people fight with one another it is because they fail to act in love If they could consider the other persons point of view if they could step back from the situation if they could just see the other person as a brother or sister then perhaps they could get passed the difficulties but so often people cannot In these situations what is needed is love and forgiveness Somehow we as Christians need to find a way to break into the struggles between two people and show them love in order to enable them to forgive one another and move on This will never be an easy thing to do but it is only by breaking these cycles that wars between individuals will be resolved As we walk with the Spirit we must endeavour to live at peace with those around us and to work to resolve conflicts between those we know and love On a wider world scale peace is even more difficult to achieve When two nations are at war conflict resolution is never easy especially if the war has been going on a long time ask the people of IsraelPalestine So often in these situations we feel powerless We feel that there is no way that such a conflict can be resolved There is no way that everyone can be happy and so we think that the war will just continue forever Perhaps a ceasefire could exist for a while but it will never last When we feel these things we must look to the places in the world where conflict has been resolved Look at Northern Ireland For so long troubles raged and most people thought the conflict would never be resolved Feelings were so raw hatred so ingrained fear so prominentand yet look at it today Okay so its not perfect but its an awful lot better than it was twenty years ago So we can have hope for peace in troubled regions If Protestants and Catholics in Ireland can put aside their differences for the sake of peace and a better future for their children then maybe peace can come elsewhere too Peace is not just about the absence of war it is much more than that When we hope and pray for peace we dont just want the fighting to stop we want justice to be done Im a historian or at least I was for a while whilst I was a student I studied predominantly twentieth century history Many of you who studied history even to GCSE level will be able to look at what happened in Europe in the twentieth century and see the problems that an unfair peace can bring After the end of the First World War the peace treaty that was drawn up was stacked massively in favour of the victors and the German people did not forget this easily During his rise to power Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party played on peoples sense of betrayal and the anger that they felt about the treaties that ended the First World War Perhaps if the earlier peace agreements had been fairer the Second World War may not have taken place Obviously this was just one of a number of factors but it was certainly a factor So when we look for peace now we must learn our lessons from history We mustnt just look to stop fighting but we must look for as just and as reasonable solution to the conflict as is possible in order to reduce the risk of future conflict breaking out Similarly in many countries peace is maintained by fear and aggression Dictators or totalitarian regimes can rule countries that to the outside world appear to be peaceful and yet they are far from it Freedom of speech may be limited an often people are imprisoned if they threaten the stability of the country even if this is just by writing something in a newspaper or holding a peaceful protest Again this kind of peace isnt necessarily preferable to conflict Peace is only really peace if it comes with justice and freedom There is a hymn in the Methodist hymn book Hymns and Psalms that speaks about the desire for peace Some of you may know it though Im not sure how well known it is It is by Alan Gaunt and reads We pray for peace but not the easy peace built on complacency and not the truth of God We pray for real peace the peace Gods love alone can seal We pray for peace but not the cruel peace leaving Gods poor bereft and dying in distress we pray for real peace enriching all the human race We pray for peace and not the evil peace defending unjust laws and nursing prejudice but for the real peace of justice mercy truth and love We pray for peace holy communion with Christ our risen Lord and every living thing Gods will fulfilled on earth and all his creatures reconciled We pray for peace and for the sake of peace look to the risen Christ who gives the grace we need to serve the cause of peace and make our own selfsacrifice God give us peace if you withdraw your love there is no peace for us nor any hope of it With you to lead us on through death or tumult peace will come The message I leave you about peace is this If we are to walk with the Spirit we are called to strive for a peace that is just and true between ourselves and others between communities peoples and nations however difficult this may be

Also before the rules which would be introduced at the end of the th century and further developed in the th century it was much more of a no holds barred form of conflict Quick research into fighting manuals and instruction books of the day will provide evidence of throws and locks eyegouging headbutting and even open palmed strikes There are even indicators that kicking was involved Certainly when an opponent got you to the ground he was allowed to kick you where you lay a practice known as purring This sounds so rough and ready that many readers may form the impression that such combat was just scrappy free for all brawling

My experience with heathenry lead me to my Lady Freyja The goddess dancing in the golden sunlight of her own glory the sexual drive of the cosmos the tendency of two things to become one in order to become or create a third The joy celebrating existence The lover seeking out the ecstasy she once had and has lost The utter feeling of loss at no longer feeling that ecstasy The passion of the body the dancing of the bodies flying through the cosmos the tango of the aurora borealis All these things are Freyja and these are what I worship
